You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 490
- Name: Sum of Natural Numbers Sequence
- Domain: Mathematics
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
The problem is about identifying the sequence and sum of N natural increasing numbers. The sequence is written in groups: 1; 2,3; 4,5,6; 7,8,9,10; ... and the task is to add the groups. This is also known as the 'sum of the next n natural numbers'. The sequence M(n) of magic constants for n X n magic squares (numbered 1 through n^2) from n=3 begins M(n) = 15, 34, 65, 111, 175, 260, .. The number of solutions (without the 'identify constraint') for n is n*n-n. The problem is to find an array of n natural numbers (x) and their sum (z) such that all numbers in x are different, x is in increasing order, the difference between the last and first number in x is n-1, and the sum z equals n*(n*n + 1) / 2. The problem is inspired by the 'farmer and cows' problem where n=9.


MiniZinc Model:
include "globals.mzn"; 

int: n = 9; % the farmer and cows problem

% decision variables
array[1..n] of var 1..n*n: x;
var 0..n*n*n: z = sum(x);


% solve satisfy;
solve :: int_search(x, first_fail, indomain_min, complete) satisfy;

constraint
   alldifferent(x) /\
   increasing(x) /\
   x[n] - x[1] = n-1

   % "identify constraint"
   % identify the sequence for the "farmer and cows" solution
   /\ z = n*(n*n + 1) div 2
;

output [
  "z: " ++ show(z) ++ "\n" ++
  "x: " ++ show(x) ++ "\n"
];

Expected Output:
{
  "x": [
    37,
    38,
    39,
    40,
    41,
    42,
    43,
    44,
    45
  ]
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
