You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 278
- Name: Schurr Lemma Problem
- Domain: Academic
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
# Problem SchurrLemma

This is [Problem 015](https://www.csplib.org/Problems/prob015/) at CSPLib.

The problem is to put n balls labelled 1,...,n into 3 boxes so that for any triple of balls (x,y,z) with x+y=z,
not all are in the same box.
The variant 'mod' has been proposed by Bessiere Meseguer Freuder Larrosa, "On forward checking for non-binary constraint satisfaction", 2002.

## Example
  A solution for 5 integers to put inside 4 boxes:
  ```
    1 2 1 2 3
  ```

## Data
  A pair (n,d) where n is the number of balls, d the number of boxes

## Model
  There are two variants of this problem, one with NValues, the other one with AllDifferent

  constraints: [AllDifferent](http://pycsp.org/documentation/constraints/AllDifferent), [NValues](http://pycsp.org/documentation/constraints/NValues)

## Execution
  - python SchurrLemma.py -data=[number,number]
  - python SchurrLemma.py -data=[number,number] -variant=mod

MiniZinc Model:
include "globals.mzn";

% Number of balls
int: n = 5;

% Number of boxes
int: d = 4;

% Array to hold the box number for each ball
array[1..n] of var 1..d: box;

% Constraint: For any three balls (x, y, z) where x + y = z, all three balls are not placed in the same box
constraint forall(i in 1..n, j in i+1..n, k in j+1..n) (
  if i + j = k then
    box[i] != box[j] \/ box[i] != box[k] \/ box[j] != box[k]
  endif
);

% NValues variant: The number of distinct values (or labels) in each box is equal to the total number of boxes
constraint forall(i in 1..d) (
  sum(j in 1..n) (box[j] = i) = d
);

% AllDifferent variant: All balls in each box have different labels
constraint forall(i in 1..d) (
  alldifferent([box[j] | j in 1..n where box[j] = i])
);

solve satisfy;

output ["Box for ball " ++ show(i) ++ ": " ++ show(box[i]) ++ "\n" | i in 1..n];

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
