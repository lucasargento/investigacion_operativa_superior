You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 388
- Name: Markov Chain Steady State and Cost Analysis
- Domain: Operations Research
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
This problem is about Markov Chains and is based on the Fertilizer example from Hamdy Taha's 'Operations Research' (8th edition), page 649ff. The problem involves a transition matrix of size 3x3, which represents the probabilities of transitioning from one state to another. The goal is to calculate the steady state probability of this transition matrix, which is the long-term probability distribution of the states of the system. Additionally, the problem involves calculating the mean first return time from a steady state probability array, which is the expected time to return to a state for the first time. The problem also involves calculating the total cost, which is the sum of the cost of each state multiplied by its steady state probability. The cost of each state is given. The problem is solved when the steady state probabilities, the mean first return times, and the total cost are found.


MiniZinc Model:
int: n = 3;
array[1..n, 1..n] of float: mat;
array[1..n] of var 0.0..1.0: p; % probabilities
array[1..n] of var 0.0..1.0: mean_first_return_time;
array[1..n] of float: cost; % cost, page 651
var 0.0..1000.0: tot_cost;


% solve satisfy;
solve :: float_search(p++mean_first_return_time, 0.00001, input_order, indomain_split, complete) satisfy;

   }
   in
    forall(i in 1..len) (
     prob[i] = sum(j in 1..len) (prob[j]* m[j,i])

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.
