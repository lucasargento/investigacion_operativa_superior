You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 566
- Name: Relief Effort Coordination
- Domain: Logistics
- Objective: minimization

Problem Description:
The problem is about coordinating relief efforts after catastrophes such as civil unrest and natural disasters. The map shows the locations of 20 villagers, each represented by a 'hut' icon. The villagers are in need of relief supplies contained in the crates attached to parachutes. There are two identical relief packages available. The only delivery option is by air drop. Each package can be dropped on any cell. After the crates are dropped, each villager will walk to the nearest drop location to pick up relief supplies. The distance between cells is calculated using a direct line. For example, the distance between A1 and A2 is 1km and the distance between A1 to B2 is 1.41 km. Each crate contains an unlimited amount of relief supplies. The problem is to determine which two drop locations will minimize the total distance that all villagers must travel.


MiniZinc Model:
include "globals.mzn"; 

int: n = 10;
array[1..n, 1..n] of int: huts;

% decision variables

% the two cells to drop the packages
array[1..2, 1..2] of var 1..n: x;

% all the distances (squared) from each cell to 
% the nearest package
array[1..n, 1..n] of var 0..n*n: distances;


% total distance
var int: total_dist;

% solve satisfy;
% solve minimize total_dist;
solve :: int_search(
        [x[i,j] | i,j in 1..2], 
        first_fail,
        indomain_split,
        complete) 
    % satisfy;
    minimize total_dist;

% 
% Calculate the distance between two cells.
% 
% Note: d is the _squared_ distance since I want to use 
% var int (and there is no support sqrt for var float).
% This doesn't matter here anyway.
%

               int: i2, int: j2, var int: d) =
      d = abs(i1-i2)*abs(i1-i2) +
          abs(j1-j2)*abs(j1-j2)
;

% for solve satisfy
% constraint total_dist = 178;

      % check the distances to the two package cells
      % and pick the nearest.

      % assign to the nearest package cell
      distances[i,j] = min([dist1, dist2]) 
   )

   /\ % assign 0 distance to cells with no hut
   forall(i, j in 1..n where huts[i,j] = 0) (
     distances[i,j] = 0
   )

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.
