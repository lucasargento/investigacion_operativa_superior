You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 405
- Name: Cruise Ticket Profit Maximization
- Domain: Business
- Objective: maximization

Problem Description:
A cruise ship can take at most 1500 people . A profit of $ 500 is made on each long - term cruise ticket and a profit of $ 150 is made on each week - long cruise ticket . There are a minimum of 35 long - term cruise tickets available . However , at least 4 times as many people prefer to buy week - long cruise tickets than long - term cruise tickets . How many of each ticket should be sold to maximize profit ?


MiniZinc Model:
include "globals.mzn";

% number of long-term cruise tickets
var 35..1500: long_term;
% number of week-long cruise tickets
var 0..1500: week_long;

% total number of people on the cruise ship
constraint long_term + week_long <= 1500;

% at least 4 times as many people prefer to buy week-long cruise tickets than long-term cruise tickets
constraint week_long >= 4 * long_term;

% profit from each type of ticket, 500 for long term and 150 for short term
var int: profit_long_term = 500 * long_term;
var int: profit_week_long = 150 * week_long;

% total profit
var int: total_profit = profit_long_term + profit_week_long;

% maximize total profit
solve maximize total_profit;

output ["Long-term tickets: " ++ show(long_term) ++ "\nWeek-long tickets: " ++ show(week_long) ++ "\nTotal profit: " ++ show(total_profit)];

Expected Output:
{
  "long_term": 300,
  "week_long": 1200,
  "_objective": 330000
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
