You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 516
- Name: Smallest Number with Persistence Five
- Domain: Number Theory
- Objective: minimization

Problem Description:
The problem is about finding the smallest number with a persistence of five. A number's persistence is defined as the number of steps required to reduce it to a single digit by multiplying all its digits to obtain a second number, then multiplying all the digits of that number to obtain a third number, and so on until a one-digit number is obtained. For example, the number 77 has a persistence of four because it requires four steps to reduce it to one digit: 77-49-36-18-8. The smallest number of persistence one is 10, of persistence two is 25, of persistence three is 39, and of persistence four is 77. The task is to find the smallest number of persistence five.


MiniZinc Model:
include "globals.mzn"; 

int: num_steps = 5; % i.e. the persistence
int: max_size = num_steps;

% decision variables
var 0..pow(10,max_size)-1: num; % the number to start with

array[0..num_steps, 1..max_size] of var 0..9: x;
array[0..num_steps] of var 1..pow(10,max_size)-1: nums;

% functions
function var int: to_num_base(array[int] of var int: a, int: base) =
          let { int: len = card(index_set(a));
                var int: n = sum(i in index_set(a)) (
                   pow(base, len-i) * a[i] 
                 );
         } in n
;

% base 10
function var int: to_num(array[int] of var int: a) = to_num_base(a, 10);

% solve satisfy;
solve minimize num;
% solve maximize num;
% solve :: int_search(array1d(x) ++ nums, first_fail, indomain_split, complete) minimize num;

constraint
  nums[0] = num /\
  nums[0] = to_num([x[0,i] | i in 1..max_size]) /\
  forall(s in 1..num_steps) (
    % note: don't multiply with leading 0's
    nums[s] = product([if x[s-1,i] > 0 then x[s-1,i] else 1 endif | i in 1..max_size]) 
    /\
    nums[s] = to_num([x[s,i] | i in 1..max_size])
  )
  
  /\ % we want a solution in exactly num_steps steps
  nums[num_steps] != nums[num_steps-1] 

  % redundant constraints
  /\ % requires that last number is a single digit
  forall(i in 1..max_size-1) ( x[num_steps,i] = 0)

  /\ nums[num_steps] < 10
  % /\ decreasing(nums) % much faster
;

output [
  "nums: \(nums)\n"
]
++
[
  if i = 1 then "\n" else " " endif ++
    show(x[s,i])
  | s in 0..num_steps, i in 1..max_size
]
;

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
