You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 294
- Name: SuperNumber
- Domain: Mathematics
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
# Problem SuperNumber

We are looking for the 10-digit number which satisfies the following conditions:
  - all digits from 0-9 occur exactly once
  - the first 2 digits are divisible by 2
  - the first 3 digits are divisible by 3
  - ...
  - the first 10 digits are divisible by 10

Using divisibility rules allows us to use less expensive operations (constraints), but a less compact model.

## Data
  all integrated (single problem)

## Model
  constraints: [AllDifferent](http://pycsp.org/documentation/constraints/AllDifferent), [Sum](http://pycsp.org/documentation/constraints/Sum)

## Execution
```
  python SuperNumber.py
  python SuperNumber.py -variant=rules
```

MiniZinc Model:
include "globals.mzn";

% Define the variable for the 10-digit number
array[1..10] of var 0..9: digits;

% Each digit from 0 to 9 is used exactly once
constraint alldifferent(digits);

% The number formed by the first two digits is divisible by 2
constraint digits[2] mod 2 = 0;

% The number formed by the first three digits is divisible by 3
constraint sum([digits[i] | i in 1..3]) mod 3 = 0;

% This pattern continues up to the point where the number formed by the first ten digits is divisible by 10
constraint sum([digits[i] | i in 1..4]) mod 4 = 0;
constraint sum([digits[i] | i in 1..5]) mod 5 = 0;
constraint sum([digits[i] | i in 1..6]) mod 6 = 0;
constraint sum([digits[i] | i in 1..7]) mod 7 = 0;
constraint sum([digits[i] | i in 1..8]) mod 8 = 0;
constraint sum([digits[i] | i in 1..9]) mod 9 = 0;
constraint sum([digits[i] | i in 1..10]) mod 10 = 0;

% Solve the problem
solve satisfy;

% Output the solution
output ["The 10-digit number is: " ++ show(digits)];

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
