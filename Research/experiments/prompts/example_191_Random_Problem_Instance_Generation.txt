You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 191
- Name: Random Problem Instance Generation
- Domain: Randomized Algorithms
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
The problem is about generating random problem instances in MiniZinc. The model generates an array of random integers and an array of random floats using a seed and a mod value. The seed can be defined via command line via the -D option. The model also defines an array of decision variables 'x'. The model then applies a constraint on the decision variables such that for all 'i' in the range 1 to 'n-1', 'x[i]' is greater than or equal to 0 and the sum of 'x[i]' and 'x[i+1]' is equal to the sum of 'rand[i]' and 'rand[i+1]'. The model then outputs the arrays of random integers, random floats, and the decision variables.


MiniZinc Model:
include "random_function.mzn"; 

int: n = 20;
int: mod_value = 10;
int: seed = 1;

% random integers
array[int] of int: rand = random_int(n, seed, mod_value);

% float (not used in the model, just for show)
array[int] of float: rand_float = random_float(n, seed, mod_value);

% decision variables
array[1..n] of var int: x;

% solve satisfy;
solve :: int_search(x, first_fail, indomain_min, complete) satisfy;

constraint
   % just a silly test
   forall(i in 1..n-1) (
     x[i] >= 0 /\
     x[i+1]+x[i] = (rand[i]+rand[i+1])
   )   
;

output [
  "rand: " ++ show(rand) ++ "\n" ++
  "rand_float: " ++ show(rand_float) ++ "\n" ++
  "x   : " ++ show(x) ++ "\n" 
 
];

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
