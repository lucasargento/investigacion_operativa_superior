You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 521
- Name: Martin Gardner's Four Digits Puzzle
- Domain: Puzzles
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
This problem is a puzzle presented by Martin Gardner in July 1971. The puzzle is as follows: ABCD are four consecutive digits in increasing order, DBCA are the same four in decreasing order. The four dots represent the same four digits in an unknown order. If the sum of ABCD, DBCA, and the number represented by the four dots is 12300, what number is represented by the four dots? The task is to find the values of A, B, C, D, and the number represented by the four dots that satisfy these conditions.


MiniZinc Model:
include "globals.mzn"; 
var 1..9: A;
var 1..9: B;
var 1..9: C;
var 1..9: D;
array[1..4] of var 1..9: fd = [A,B,C,D];

array[1..4] of var 1..9: dots;
var int: dots_num;

var int: ABCD = 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + D;
var int: DCBA = 1000*D + 100*C + 10*B + A;


predicate toNum10(array[int] of var int: a, var int: n) =
          let { int: len = length(a) }
          in
          n = sum(i in 1..len) (
            ceil(pow(10.0, int2float(len-i))) * a[i]
          )
          /\ forall(i in 1..len) (a[i] >= 0)
;

predicate contains(var int: e, array[int] of var int: a) =
   exists(i in 1..length(a)) (
      a[i] = e
   )
;

% solve satisfy;
solve :: int_search(fd ++ dots ++ [ABCD, DCBA, dots_num], first_fail, indomain_min, complete) satisfy;

constraint
  all_different(fd)
  /\
  increasing(fd)
  /\
  all_different(dots)
  /\
  toNum10(dots, dots_num)
  /\
  12300 = ABCD + DCBA + dots_num

  /\ % dots consist of the the digits A, B, C, and D
  contains(A, dots) 
  /\
  contains(B, dots) 
  /\
  contains(C, dots) 
  /\
  contains(D, dots) 
;

output [
   "  ", show(ABCD), "\n",
   "  ", show(DCBA), "\n",
   "+ ", show(dots_num), "\n",
   "------", "\n",
   " 12300","\n"

];

Expected Output:
{
  "A": 2,
  "B": 3,
  "C": 4,
  "D": 5,
  "dots": [
    4,
    5,
    2,
    3
  ],
  "dots_num": 4523
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
