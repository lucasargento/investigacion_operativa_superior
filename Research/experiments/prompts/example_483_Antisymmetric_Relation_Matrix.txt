You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 483
- Name: Antisymmetric Relation Matrix
- Domain: Mathematics
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
The problem is to define the concept of antisymmetric in the context of a relation. An antisymmetric relation is one where no element is related to itself (no one is richer than him-/herself) and if one element is related to another, the second is not related to the first (if i is richer than j then j is not richer than i). The problem is modeled as a 4x4 matrix where each cell represents a binary relation between two elements. The goal is to find a configuration of this matrix that satisfies the antisymmetric property. Two versions of the antisymmetric property are defined, one directly from the definition and another as an alternative version.


MiniZinc Model:
int: n = 4;
array[1..n, 1..n] of var 0..1: x;

%
%
predicate antisymmetric1(array[int, int] of var 0..1: x) =
   let {
       int: n = card(index_set_1of2(x))
   }
   in
   %  not(iRi)
   forall(i in 1..n) (
      x[i,i] = 0
   )
   /\ % if iRj then not(jRi)
   forall(i, j in 1..n where i != j) (
      x[i,j] = 1 <-> x[j,i] = 0
   )
;

%
% Alternative version from the definition in
% http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisymmetric_relation
%  * if aRb with a != b, then not bRa
%
predicate antisymmetric2(array[int, int] of var 0..1: x) =
   let {
       int: n = card(index_set_1of2(x))
   }
   in
   forall(a, b in 1..n) (
      (x[a,b] = 1 /\ a != b) <-> x[b,a] = 0
   )
;


solve satisfy;
% solve :: int_search(x, "first_fail", "indomain", "complete") satisfy;

constraint
   antisymmetric1(x)
   % antisymmetric2(x)
;

output[
  if j = 1 then "\n" else " " endif ++
    show(x[i,j])
  | i, j in 1..n
] 
++ 
["\n"]
;

Expected Output:
{
  "x": [
    [
      0,
      1,
      1,
      1
    ],
    [
      0,
      0,
      1,
      1
    ],
    [
      0,
      0,
      0,
      1
    ],
    [
      0,
      0,
      0,
      0
    ]
  ]
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
