You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 298
- Name: Tobacco Puzzle
- Domain: Puzzles
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
This problem is known as the Tobacco puzzle or Clarke's tobacconist problem. It is a simple integer programming problem. The problem is to find two non-negative integers x[1] and x[2] such that the equation 25*x[1] + 49*x[2] = 2000 is satisfied. The problem was originally presented in the book 'Fun with Figures' by L.H. Clarke in 1954.


MiniZinc Model:
array[1..2] of var int: x;

solve satisfy;

constraint 
  25*x[1] + 49*x[2] = 2000
  /\
  forall(i in 1..2) (
    x[i] >= 0
  )
;


output [show(x)];

Expected Output:
{
  "x": [
    80,
    0
  ]
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
