You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 90
- Name: Food Purchase Optimization
- Domain: Healthcare and Human Systems
- Objective: minimization

Problem Description:
We want to create an optimized and economical nutritional diet. For each food type that is available in the market, we have the price per unit and the amount of each of the nutrients that we are tracking that it contains per unit of food. If we have a demand for each of the nutrients that we are tracking, how much of each type of food should we buy to minimize the cost of meeting all our nutritional demands?


Input Data (data.dzn):
K = 3;
M = 2;
Price = [1, 2, 3];
Demand = [10, 20];
Nutrition = array2d(1..3, 1..2, [3, 5, 1, 3, 4, 4]);


MiniZinc Model:
% Empty model file

Expected Output:
{
  "_objective": 4.0
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
