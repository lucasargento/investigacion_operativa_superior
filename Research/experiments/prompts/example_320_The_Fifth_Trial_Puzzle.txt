You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 320
- Name: The Fifth Trial Puzzle
- Domain: Puzzles
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
The problem is a puzzle known as 'The Fifth Trial' from Smullyan, R., (1991), The Lady or The Tiger, Oxford University Press. The puzzle involves two doors and two prizes (1 = Lady, 2 = Tiger). Each door hides one prize. The puzzle is represented by two sets, D (doors) and P (prizes), and two arrays, x and t. The array x[i,j] is 1 if door i hides prize j, else 0. The array t[i] is 1 if the statement on door i is true, else 0. The constraints of the problem are as follows: each door hides 1 prize, if door i hides prize i then statement i is true else false, if the statement on door 1 is true [i.e. x[1,1]+x[2,1]>=2] then set t[1] = 1, else t[1] = 0, and if the statement on door 2 is true then set t[2] = 1, else t[2] = 0. The goal is to find a configuration of prizes behind doors and truth values of statements that satisfies all these constraints.


MiniZinc Model:
int: door = 2;
int: prize = 2;	% 1 = Lady, 2 = Tiger

set of 1..door: D = 1..door;
set of 1..prize: P = 1..prize;
array[D,P] of var 0..1: x;   % x(i,j) = 1 if door i hides prize j, else 0
array[D] of var 0..1: t;     % t(i) = 1 if statement on door i is true, else 0

solve satisfy;

constraint
  % each door hides 1 prize
  forall(i in D) (
    sum(j in P) (x[i,j]) = 1
  )
  /\
  % if door i hides prize i then statement i is true else false
  forall(i in D) (
     x[i,i] = t[i]
  )
  /\ % if statement on door 1 is true [i.e. x[1,1]+x[2,1]>=2] then set t[1] = 1, else t[1] = 0
  x[1,1]+x[2,1]-t[1] <= 0 /\
  x[1,1]+x[2,1]-t[1] >= 0 

  /\ % if statement on door 2 is true then set t[2] = 1, else t[2] = 0
  x[1,1] = t[2]
;

output 
[
  if j = 1 then "\n" else " " endif ++
    show(x[i,j])
  | i in D, j in P
] ++
[
 if i = 1 then "\n" else "" endif ++
 show(t[i]) ++ "\n"
 | i in D
];

Expected Output:
{
  "x": [
    [
      1,
      0
    ],
    [
      0,
      1
    ]
  ],
  "t": [
    1,
    1
  ]
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.
