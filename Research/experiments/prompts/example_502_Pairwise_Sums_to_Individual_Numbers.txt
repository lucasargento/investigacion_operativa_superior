You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 502
- Name: Pairwise Sums to Individual Numbers
- Domain: Mathematics
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
The problem is about finding the individual numbers from their pairwise sums given in non-decreasing order. If the sum is corrupted, the output should be -1. For example, if the input is [4, 5, 7, 10, 12, 13], the output should be [1, 3, 4, 9] because these numbers' pairwise sums in non-decreasing order are the given input. The problem is modeled and solved using the MiniZinc constraint programming language. The model includes constraints to ensure that the pairwise sums of the individual numbers match the given input and that the individual numbers are in increasing order.


MiniZinc Model:
include "globals.mzn"; 
int: n = 6;
% array[1..n] of var 1..13: input; %  = [4, 5, 7, 10, 12, 13 ];
array[1..n] of int: input = [4, 5, 7, 10, 12, 13 ];

int: m = 4;
array[1..m] of var 0..ub_array(input): x;

% solve satisfy;
solve :: int_search(x, anti_first_fail, indomain_split, complete) satisfy;

% arrays of 1d where both arguments are var int
predicate cp1d(array[int] of var int: x, array[int] of var int: y) =
  assert(index_set(x) = index_set(y),
           "cp1d: x and y have different sizes",
     forall(i in index_set(x)) ( x[i] = y[i] ))
; 


% For generating all variants
% constraint
%    trace("ub_array(input): " ++ show(ub_array(input)) ++ "\n", 1=1) /\
%    forall(i in 2..n) (
%      input[i-1] < input[i]
%    )
%    % /\ % cp1d(input,  [4, 5, 7, 10, 12, 13 ])
% ;

constraint
   forall(k in 1..n) (
     let {
      var 1..m: i,
      var 1..m: j
     } in
      i < j /\
      x[i]+x[j] = input[k]
   )
   /\ increasing(x) % symmetry breaking
   % /\ alldifferent(x)
;

% Alternative but slower:
% constraint
%    forall(k in 1..n) (
%      exists(i, j in 1..m where i < j) ( 
%         x[i]+x[j] = input[k]
%      )
%    )
%    /\ increasing(x) % symmetry breaking
%    % /\ alldifferent(x)
% ;


output [
  "input: " ++ show(input) ++ "\n" ++
  "x    : " ++ show(x) ++ "\n"  
]
 ++ ["\n"]
;

Expected Output:
{
  "x": [
    1,
    3,
    4,
    9
  ]
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.
