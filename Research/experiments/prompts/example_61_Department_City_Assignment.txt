You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 61
- Name: Department City Assignment
- Domain: Economic and Business Decisions
- Objective: maximization

Problem Description:
The problem involves some departments that need to be located in some cities. Each department has a certain benefit associated with each city, and there are communication costs between each pair of cities. All departments start in a single city, but have the option to relocate to another city. We are given the cost of relocating to the candidate options. The goal is to maximize the total savings, which is the sum of the benefits of each department in each city minus the communication costs between each pair of departments in each pair of cities. The constraints are that each department must be located in one city, and there can be at most 3 departments in each city.


Input Data (data.dzn):
ndepts = 5;  % departments
ncities = 3; %  cities, Bristol, Brighton, london
ncitiesm1 = 2; % cities, Bristol, Brighton

% benefits (£k)
benefit = array2d(1..ndepts, 1..ncities, 
              [10,10,0,
               15,20,0, 
               10,15,0,
               20,15,0,
               5,15,0]); 

%  communication costs/unit(£)
dist = array2d(1..ncities, 1..ncities, [5,14,13,14,5,9,13,9,10]);

% quantities of communication (k units)
comm = array2d(1..ndepts, 1..ndepts, 
        [0.0,0.0,1.0,1.5,0.0,
         0.0,0.0,1.4,1.2,0.0,
         0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,
         0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7,

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
