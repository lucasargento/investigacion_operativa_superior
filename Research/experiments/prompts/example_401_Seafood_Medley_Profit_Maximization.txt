You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 401
- Name: Seafood Medley Profit Maximization
- Domain: Business Optimization
- Objective: maximization

Problem Description:
A seafood market sells scallops , mussels , and oysters in packages named seafood medley one and seafood medley two . A package of seafood medley one contains 20 grams of scallops , 30 grams of mussels , and 50 grams of oysters . A package of seafood medley two contains 40 grams of scallops , 40 grams of mussels , and 20 grams of oysters . The market has available 10000 grams of scallops , 12000 grams of mussels , and 11000 grams of oysters . If the profit per package of seafood medley one is $ 20 and the profit per package of seafood medley two is $ 25 , how many of each should be sold to maximize profit ?


MiniZinc Model:
include "globals.mzn";

% number of packages of seafood medley one
var int: medley_one;
% number of packages of seafood medley two
var int: medley_two;

% number of packages are non-negative
constraint medley_one >= 0;
constraint medley_two >= 0;

% number of available scallops is 10000 grams
% medley one contains 20 grams of scallops and medley two contains 40 grams of scallops
constraint 20 * medley_one + 40 * medley_two <= 10000;

% number of available mussels is 12000 grams
% medley one contains 30 grams of mussels and medley two contains 40 grams of mussels
constraint 30 * medley_one + 40 * medley_two <= 12000;

% number of available oysters is 11000 grams
% medley one contains 50 grams of mussels and medley two contains 20 grams of mussels
constraint 50 * medley_one + 20 * medley_two <= 11000;

% profit from medley one is $20 each and profit from medley two is $25 each 
var int: profit = 20 * medley_one + 25 * medley_two;

% maximize profit
solve maximize profit;

% output
output ["Seafood Medley One: " ++ show(medley_one) ++ "\nSeafood Medley Two: " ++ show(medley_two) ++ "\nProfit: $" ++ show(profit)];

Expected Output:
{
  "medley_one": 150,
  "medley_two": 175,
  "_objective": 7375
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
