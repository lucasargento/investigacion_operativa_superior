You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 201
- Name: Linear Regression with Minimax Criterion
- Domain: Statistics
- Objective: minimization

Problem Description:
Fit the ‘best’ straight line y = bx + a where the objective is to minimize the maximum deviation of all the K observed values of Y from the value predicted by the linear relationship. The observed values of y are given by Y and the observed values of x are given by X.


Input Data (data.dzn):
Here is the data in ".dzn" format:

```
NumObs = 19;
Y = [1.0, 0.9, 0.7, 1.5, 2.0, 2.4, 3.2, 2.0, 2.7, 3.5, 1.0, 4.0, 3.6, 2.7, 5.7, 4.6, 6.0, 6.8, 7.3];
X = [0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 1.9, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.6, 7.0, 7.6, 8.5, 9.0, 10.0];
```

MiniZinc Model:
% Define the parameters
int: NumObs; % Number of observations
array[1..NumObs] of float: Y; % Observed values of y
array[1..NumObs] of float: X; % Observed values of x

% Define the decision variables
var float: intercept; % Intercept of the fitted line
var float: slope; % Slope of the fitted line
array[1..NumObs] of var float: deviation; % Deviation of observed y from predicted y

% Constraints
constraint forall(i in 1..NumObs) (
    deviation[i] >= Y[i] - (slope * X[i] + intercept) /\
    deviation[i] >= (slope * X[i] + intercept) - Y[i]
);

% Objective: Minimize the maximum deviation
solve minimize max(deviation);

% Output the solution
output ["intercept: ", show(intercept), "\nslope: ", show(slope)];

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
