You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 208
- Name: Auto Parts Manufacturer Optimization
- Domain: Manufacturing
- Objective: maximization

Problem Description:
How many batches of each part should the manufacturer produce each month to maximize profit, taking into account the number of machines (M), the number of types of parts (P), the time required to produce a batch on machine m for part p (TimeRequired), the cost of operating machine m for a month (MachineCosts), the time each machine m is available for production each month (Availability), the price at which part p can be sold (Prices), and the setup time required before producing a batch of part p (SetupTime)?


Input Data (data.dzn):
time_required = [|2, 1, 3, 2|4, 2, 1, 2|6, 2, 1, 2|];
machine_costs = [160, 10, 15];
availability = [200, 300, 500];
prices = [570, 250, 585, 430];
setup_time = [12, 8, 4, 0];

MiniZinc Model:
% Parameters
int: M; % Number of machines
int: P; % Number of parts
array[1..M, 1..P] of int: time_required; % Time required to produce a batch on machine m for part p
array[1..M] of int: machine_costs; % Cost of operating machine m for a month
array[1..M] of int: availability; % Time each machine m is available for production each month
array[1..P] of int: prices; % Price at which part p can be sold
array[1..P] of int: setup_time; % Setup time required before producing a batch of part p

% Decision Variables
array[1..P] of var 0..availability[1] div (time_required[1,1] + setup_time[1]): batches; % Number of batches of each part to produce
array[1..P] of var 0..1: setup_flags; % Whether part p is set up or not

% Constraints
constraint forall(m in 1..M)(
    sum(p in 1..P)(time_required[m,p] * batches[p]) + sum(p in 1..P)(setup_flags[p] * setup_time[p]) <= availability[m]
);

% Objective
var int: total_profit = sum(p in 1..P)(prices[p] * batches[p]) - sum(m in 1..M)(machine_costs[m] * availability[m]);
solve maximize total_profit;

% Output
output ["batches: ", show(batches), "\n", "setup_flags: ", show(setup_flags), "\n", "total_profit: ", show(total_profit)];

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
