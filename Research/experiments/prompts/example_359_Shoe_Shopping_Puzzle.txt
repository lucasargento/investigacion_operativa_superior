You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 359
- Name: Shoe Shopping Puzzle
- Domain: Puzzles
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
Harriet has returned from the mall and is describing her four shoe purchases to her friend Aurora. She bought four different kinds of shoes: ecru espadrilles, fuchsia flats, purple pumps, and suede sandals. However, she can't recall at which different store (Foot Farm, Heels in a Handcart, The Shoe Palace, or Tootsies) she got each pair. The task is to figure out the order in which Harriet bought each pair of shoes, and where she bought each. The following clues are given: 1. Harriet bought fuchsia flats at Heels in a Handcart. 2. The store she visited just after buying her purple pumps was not Tootsies. 3. The Foot Farm was Harriet's second stop. 4. Two stops after leaving The Shoe Place, Harriet bought her suede sandals. The goal is to determine the order of the shoes and the corresponding store.


MiniZinc Model:
include "globals.mzn"; 

int: n = 4;
set of int: r = 1..4;

var r: ecru_espadrilles;
var r: fuchsia_flats;
var r: purple_pumps;
var r: suede_sandals;

var r: Foot_Farm;
var r: Heels_in_a_Handcart;
var r: The_Shoe_Palace;
var r: Tootsies;

array[1..n] of var r: shoes = [ecru_espadrilles, fuchsia_flats, purple_pumps, suede_sandals];
array[1..n] of var r: shops = [Foot_Farm, Heels_in_a_Handcart, The_Shoe_Palace, Tootsies];



solve satisfy;
% solve :: int_search(x, "first_fail", "indomain", "complete") satisfy;

constraint
  all_different(shoes)
  /\
  all_different(shops)

  /\ % 1. Harriet bought fuchsia flats at Heels in a Handcart.
  fuchsia_flats = Heels_in_a_Handcart

  /\  %  2. The store she visited just after buying her purple pumps was not Tootsies.
  purple_pumps + 1 != Tootsies

  /\ %  3. The Foot Farm was Harriet's second stop.
  Foot_Farm = 2

  /\ %  4. Two stops after leaving The Shoe Place, Harriet bought her suede sandals.
  The_Shoe_Palace + 2 = suede_sandals

;

output [
  "shoes [ecru_espadrilles, fuchsia_flats, purple_pumps, suede_sandals] ", show(shoes),"\n",
  "shops [Foot_Farm, Heels_in_a_Handcart, The_Shoe_Palace, Tootsies]", show(shops),"\n",

];

Expected Output:
{
  "ecru_espadrilles": 2,
  "fuchsia_flats": 4,
  "purple_pumps": 1,
  "suede_sandals": 3,
  "Foot_Farm": 2,
  "Heels_in_a_Handcart": 4,
  "The_Shoe_Palace": 1,
  "Tootsies": 3
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
