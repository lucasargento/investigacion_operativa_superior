You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 53
- Name: Police Shift Scheduling
- Domain: Scheduling
- Objective: minimization

Problem Description:
The town has different shifts for the police officers during the day. The town has a requirement for the number of police officers on duty during each shift. Each police officer works for two consecutive shifts. For each shift, there is a cost for starting a shift then. How many officers should the town assign to each shift to minimize the total cost?


Input Data (data.dzn):
NumShifts = 6;
OfficersNeeded = [15, 13, 11, 11, 9, 7];
ShiftCosts = [500, 480, 450, 460, 470, 490];


MiniZinc Model:
% Empty model file

Expected Output:
{
  "_objective": 16620.0
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
