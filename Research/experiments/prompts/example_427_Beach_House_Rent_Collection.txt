You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 427
- Name: Beach House Rent Collection
- Domain: Linear Programming
- Objective: minimization

Problem Description:
Jack needs to find at least 80 shrimps and 50 conches to pay his monthly rent for his beach house . There are two beaches that Jack frequents : Silver Beach and Lucent Beach . Each day at Silver beach , Jack finds 7 shrimps and 3 conches . Each day at Lucent Beach , Jack finds 4 shrimps and 6 conches . Formulate an LP to help Jack meet his requirements while spending a minimal amount of time .


MiniZinc Model:
var int: silver_days;
% days spent at lucent beach
var int: lucent_days;

constraint silver_days >= 0;
constraint lucent_days >= 0;

% Jack needs to find at least 80 shrimps
% Jack finds 7 shrimps each day at silver beach and 4 each day at lucent beach
constraint silver_days * 7 + lucent_days * 4 >= 80;

% Jack needs to find at least 50 shrimps
% Jack finds 7 shrimps each day at silver beach and 4 each day at lucent beach
constraint silver_days * 3 + lucent_days * 6 >= 50;

var int: total_days = silver_days + lucent_days;

% minimizing the total days spent at the beaches
solve minimize total_days;

output ["Silver Beach Days: " ++ show(silver_days), "\nLucent Beach Days: " ++ show(lucent_days), "\nTotal Days: " ++ show(total_days)];

Expected Output:
{
  "silver_days": 11,
  "lucent_days": 3,
  "_objective": 14
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
