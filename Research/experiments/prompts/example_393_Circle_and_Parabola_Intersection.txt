You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 393
- Name: Circle and Parabola Intersection
- Domain: Mathematics
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
The problem is to find the intersection of a circle and a parabola. The circle is defined by the equation x^2 + y^2 = 1 and the parabola is defined by the equation x^2 = y. The goal is to find the values of x and y that satisfy both equations. The problem is solved using a constraint satisfaction approach, where the constraints are the two equations. The solution space is searched using a floating point search strategy with a precision of 0.00000000000001. The output is the values of x and y that satisfy the constraints.


MiniZinc Model:
float: v = pow(10.0,8.0);

var -v..v: x;
var -v..v: y;


% solve satisfy;
solve :: float_search([x,y], 0.00000000000001, input_order, indomain_split, complete) satisfy;

constraint
   x*x + y*y = 1.0 
   /\
   x*x = y
   
;

output [
  "x:" ++ show_float(3,12,x) ++ "\n" ++
  "y:" ++ show_float(3,12,y)
];

Expected Output:
{
  "x": -0.786151377757423,
  "y": 0.618033988749895
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
