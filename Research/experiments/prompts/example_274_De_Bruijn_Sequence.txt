You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 274
- Name: De Bruijn Sequence
- Domain: Combinatorial Mathematics
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
# Problem DeBruijn

In combinatorial mathematics, a de Bruijn sequence of order n on an alphabet A of size b is a cyclic sequence
in which every possible length-n string on A occurs exactly once as a substring.

## Data
  A pair (b,n) of integer values, the value of n and the size of the alphabet.

### Example
  For n=2 and an alphabet {a,b,c}, a sequence is
  ```
     a a c b b c c a b
  ```

## Model
  constraints: [AllDifferent](http://pycsp.org/documentation/constraints/AllDifferent), [Cardinality](http://pycsp.org/documentation/constraints/Cardinality), [Minimum](http://pycsp.org/documentation/constraints/Minimum), [Sum](http://pycsp.org/documentation/constraints/Sum)

## Execution
```
  python Debruijn.py -data=[number,number]
```

MiniZinc Model:
include "globals.mzn";

% Define the size of the alphabet and the order of the sequence
int: b = 3; % size of the alphabet
int: n = 2; % order of the sequence

% Define the sequence
array[1..b^n] of var 1..b: sequence;

% Define the constraints
constraint alldifferent(sequence);
constraint forall(i in 1..b)(sum(j in sequence)(j = i) = n);
constraint sum(sequence) = b * n;

% Solve the problem
solve satisfy;

% Output the solution
output ["Sequence: " ++ show(sequence)];

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
