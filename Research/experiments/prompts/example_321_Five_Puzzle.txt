You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 321
- Name: Five Puzzle
- Domain: Puzzles
- Objective: minimization

Problem Description:
The problem is a 5x5 puzzle, also known as the Five puzzle. The puzzle consists of a 5x5 grid where each square can be in one of two states: lit (represented by 1) or unlit (represented by 0). If a square is clicked, that square and each of its orthogonal neighbors will toggle between the two states. Each click constitutes one move and the objective of the puzzle is to light all 25 squares in the least number of moves. The problem is to find the configuration that minimizes the sum of the states of all squares, i.e., lights up all squares with the least number of moves.


MiniZinc Model:
int: n = 5;
% int: n = 11;

set of 1..n: N = 1..n;
array[N,N] of var 0..1: x;
array[N,N] of var 0..n: d;
var int: the_sum = sum(i in N, j in N) (x[i,j]);

constraint
         forall(i in N,j in N) (
                  2*d[i,j]+1 = 
             (sum(k in j-1..j+1 where k >= 1 /\ k <= n /\ k != j) (x[i,k]) + 
                       sum(k in i-1..i+1 where k >= 1 /\ k <= n) (x[k,j])) 
       )
;


% solve satisfy;
solve :: int_search([x[i,j] | i,j in N], first_fail, indomain_min, complete)  minimize the_sum;


output [
   if i = 1 /\ j = 1 then "\nThe_sum: " ++ show(the_sum) else "" endif ++
   if j = 1 then "\n" else " " endif ++
   show(x[i,j])  
   | i in N, j in N
];

Expected Output:

    [

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.
