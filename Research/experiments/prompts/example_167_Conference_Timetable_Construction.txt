You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 167
- Name: Conference Timetable Construction
- Domain: Scheduling
- Objective: minimization

Problem Description:
The problem is about constructing the timetable of a conference. The conference will consist of 11 sessions of equal length. The timetable is to be organized as a sequence of slots, where a slot can take up to 3 parallel sessions. There are the following constraints on the timing of the sessions: Session 4 must take place before Session 11. Session 5 must take place before Session 10. Session 6 must take place before Session 11. Session 1 must not be in parallel with Sessions 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, and 10. Session 2 must not be in parallel with Sessions 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, and 11. Session 3 must not be in parallel with Sessions 5, 6, and 8. Session 4 must not be in parallel with Sessions 6, 8, and 10. Session 6 must not be in parallel with Sessions 7 and 10. Session 7 must not be in parallel with Sessions 8 and 9. Session 8 must not be in parallel with Session 10. The goal is to minimize the number of slots.


MiniZinc Model:
include "globals.mzn"; 
int: num_sessions = 11;
int: max_time_slots = 11;

% precedences of sessions
int: num_precedences = 3;
array[1..num_precedences, 1..2] of int: precedences = array2d(1..num_precedences, 1..2, [
   4,11,
   5,10,
   6,11
]);

% sessions that should not be parallel
int: num_para = 8;
array[1..num_para] of set of int: parallel = [
 {2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10}, % not parallel with session 1
 {3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11}, % not parallel with session 2
 {5, 6, 8},           % not parallel with session 3
 {6, 8, 10},          % not parallel with session 4
 {},                  % not parallel with session 5 (dummy)
 {7,10},              % not parallel with session 6
 {8, 9},              % not parallel with session 7
 {10}                 % not parallel with session 8
];


%
% decision variables
%
% sessions: in what slot is this session
array[1..num_sessions] of var 1..max_time_slots: sessions;

% slots: which sessions is in which slot
% we use set representation (dual) for two reasons:
% 1) for dual representation, since it is easy to state that 
%    there should be max 3 sessions per slot
% 2) for presentation
array[1..max_time_slots] of var set of 1..num_sessions: slots; 


% number of used time slots (to be minimized)
var 1..max_time_slots: num_time_slots = max(sessions);

% solve minimize num_time_slots;
solve :: int_search(sessions, input_order, indomain_min, complete) minimize num_time_slots;


% Precedences:
constraint
  forall(p in 1..num_precedences) (
     sessions[precedences[p,1]] < sessions[precedences[p,2]]
  )
;

% parallel constraints
constraint
  forall(s in 1..num_para where card(parallel[s]) > 0) (
     forall(pp in parallel[s]) (
        sessions[s] != sessions[pp]
     )
  )
;

% channel between sessions and slots
constraint
  int_set_channel(sessions, slots)
;

% max 3 sessions per slot
constraint
  forall(s in 1..max_time_slots) (
    card(slots[s]) <= 3
  )
;

output [
"sessions: " ++ show(sessions) ++ "\n"++
"slots: " ++ show(slots) ++ "\n"++
"num_time_slots: " ++ show(num_time_slots) ++ "\n"
];

Expected Output:
{
  "sessions": [
    1,
    2,

    },
    {
      "set": [
        2,
        [
          5,
          6
        ]

    {

  "_objective": 4
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.
