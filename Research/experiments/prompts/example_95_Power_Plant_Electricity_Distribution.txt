You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 95
- Name: Power Plant Electricity Distribution
- Domain: Energy and Natural Resources
- Objective: minimization

Problem Description:
A small electric utility operates various power plants to supply electricity to certain cities. Each power plant has a capacity. Each city has a peak demand which must be met at the same time. There is a transmission cost to send electricity from each power plant to each city. How much electricity should each power plant send to each city to minimize the total transmission cost?


Input Data (data.dzn):
P = 3;
C = 2;
Supply = [30, 25, 45];
Demand = [40, 60];
TransmissionCosts = array2d(1..3, 1..2, [14, 22, 18, 12, 10, 16]);


MiniZinc Model:
% Empty model file

Expected Output:
{
  "_objective": 1380.0
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
