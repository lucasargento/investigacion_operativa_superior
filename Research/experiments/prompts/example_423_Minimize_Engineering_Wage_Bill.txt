You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 423
- Name: Minimize Engineering Wage Bill
- Domain: Workforce Scheduling
- Objective: minimization

Problem Description:
An engineering company has new grad engineers earning $ 1000 a week and senior engineers earning $ 3000 a week . The weekly wage bill must be kept below $ 100000 . The projects require a minimum of 50 engineers of whom at least 10 must be senior engineers . In addition , the number of senior engineers should be at least a third the number of new grad engineers . Formulate a LP to minimize the wage bill .


MiniZinc Model:
var int: new_grads;
% number of senior engineers
var int: senior;

% number of engineers is non-negative
constraint new_grads >= 0;
constraint senior >= 0;

% there are at least 50 engineers
constraint new_grads + senior >= 50;
% there are at least 10 senior engineers
constraint senior >= 10;
% senior engineers should be at least a third the number of new grad engineers
constraint senior >= new_grads / 3;

% new grad engineers earn 1000 a week and senior engineers earn 3000 a week
var int: wage_bill = 1000*new_grads + 3000*senior;

% weekly wage bill must be kept below $ 100000 
constraint wage_bill <= 100000;

% minimize the wage_bill
solve minimize wage_bill;

Expected Output:
{
  "new_grads": 37,
  "senior": 13,
  "_objective": 76000
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
