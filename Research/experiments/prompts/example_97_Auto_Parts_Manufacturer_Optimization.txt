You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 97
- Name: Auto Parts Manufacturer Optimization
- Domain: Manufacturing and Production
- Objective: maximization

Problem Description:
A division of an auto parts manufacturer produces different parts using Mvdifferent machines. A batch of 100 parts requires a specific amount of hours on each machine. There is a cost per hour of operating each machine, and each machine has a limited availability in hours for each month. Additionally, machine M and machine M-1 can share availability and thus individual availability conditions can be disregarded. The division sells parts in batches of 100 at a price specific to each part. Further, for each part, the division has to produce a minimum number of batches per part to fulfill a contract. How many batches of each part should the manufacturer produce each month to maximize profit?


Input Data (data.dzn):
M = 3;
P = 4;
TimeRequired = array2d(1..3, 1..4, [2, 1, 3, 2, 4, 2, 1, 2, 6, 2, 1, 2]);
MachineCosts = [160, 10, 15];
Availability = [200, 300, 500];
Prices = [570, 250, 585, 430];
MinBatches = [10, 10, 10, 10];


MiniZinc Model:
% Empty model file

Expected Output:
{
  "_objective": 10200.0
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
