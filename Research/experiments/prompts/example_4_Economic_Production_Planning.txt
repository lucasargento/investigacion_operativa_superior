You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 4
- Name: Economic Production Planning
- Domain: Economic and Business Decisions
- Objective: maximization

Problem Description:
An economy consists of several industries. Each unit produced by one of the industries (a unit will be taken as £1’s worth of value of production) requires inputs from possibly its own industry as well as other industries. For each industry, we know how much input it requires from each of the industries (including itself) and the manpower it requires. There is a time lag in the economy so the output in year t+1 requires inputs from year t. Output from an industry may also be used to build productive capacity for itself or other industries in future years. To give unit increases (capacity for £1’s worth of extra production) in productive capacity of an industry, some units of industry from each industry and some units of manpower are needed. Input from an industry in year t results in a (permanent) increase in productive capacity in year t + 2. Additionally, stocks of goods may be held from year to year. We are given the stocks of each industry and the capacity of each industry at present (year 0). Additionally, there is a limited yearly manpower capacity that cannot be changed. Maximize total production in the last two years.


Input Data (data.dzn):
K = 3;
InputOne = array2d(1..3, 1..3, [0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.1, 0.1, 0.5, 0.2, 0.2]);
ManpowerOne = [0.6, 0.3, 0.2];
InputTwo = array2d(1..3, 1..3, [0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.7, 0.1, 0.1, 0.9, 0.2, 0.2]);
ManpowerTwo = [0.4, 0.2, 0.1];
Stock = [150, 80, 100];
Capacity = [300, 350, 280];
ManpowerLimit = 470000000.0;

MiniZinc Model:
% Empty model file

Expected Output:
{
  "_objective": 2619.0
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
