You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 453
- Name: Open Among Constraint Satisfaction
- Domain: Constraint Satisfaction
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
The problem is defined by the open_among constraint. Given a set of positions S, a number NVAR, a collection of variables, and a set of values, the constraint is satisfied if the number of variables at the positions specified by S that take their value from the set of values is equal to NVAR. For example, given the set of positions S={2,3,4,5}, the number NVAR=3, the collection of variables <8,5,5,4,1>, and the set of values {1,5,8}, the constraint is satisfied because exactly 3 values from the last four values of the collection of variables belong to the set of values.


MiniZinc Model:
int: n = 5;
array[1..n] of var 1..8: variables;
var 0..n*2: nvar;
var set of 1..n: s;
% strange: values must either be initialized here or free
var set of 1..8: values = {1,5,8};


predicate open_among(var set of int: s, 
                     var int: nvar, 
                     array[int] of var int: variables,
                     var set of int: values) =

    nvar == sum(i in index_set(variables)) ( 
             bool2int(
                 i in s /\
                 variables[i] in values
             ) 
   )
;

predicate cp1d(array[int] of var int: x, array[int] of var int: y) =
  assert(index_set(x) = index_set(y),
           "cp1d: x and y have different sizes",
     forall(i in index_set(x)) ( x[i] = y[i] ))
; 

solve satisfy;

constraint
    % it fails if values is defined only here 
    % values =  {1,5,8} /\

    s = {2,3,4,5} /\
    nvar = 3 /\
    cp1d(variables, [8,5,5,4,1]) /\
    open_among(s, nvar, variables, values)
;

output
[
  "variables: " ++ show(variables) ++ "\n" ++
  "values: " ++ show(values) ++ "\n" ++
  "nvar: " ++ show(nvar) ++ "\n" ++
  "s: " ++ show(s) ++ "\n"
];

Expected Output:
{
  "variables": [
    8,
    5,
    5,
    4,
    1
  ],
  "nvar": 3,
  "s": {
    "set": [
      [
        2,
        5
      ]
    ]
  }
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.
