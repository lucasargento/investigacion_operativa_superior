You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 317
- Name: Limerick Prime Finder
- Domain: Number Theory
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
The problem is about finding a 'Limerick Prime'. A Limerick Prime is a prime number that has the form AABBA where A is an odd digit and B is any digit other than A. The task is to find such a prime number within the range of 10000 to 99999. The problem is inspired by a post from John D. Cook's blog where he discusses the concept of Limerick Primes and the smallest 14-digit prime number that follows the rhyme scheme of a Shakespearean sonnet.


MiniZinc Model:
int: n = 5;

var 10000..99999: p;
array[1..n] of var 0..9: x;

var 0..9: A;
var 0..9: B;

predicate is_prime(var int: x) =
   x > 1 
   /\
   forall(i in 2..1+ceil(sqrt(int2float(ub(x))))) ( 
        (i < x) -> (x mod i > 0)
   )
;

% channel array a <-> var int n
predicate toNum10(array[int] of var int: a, var int: n) =
          let { int: len = length(a) }
          in
          n = sum(i in 1..len) (
            ceil(pow(10.0, int2float(len-i))) * a[i]
          )
          /\ forall(i in 1..len) (a[i] >= 0)
;

% arrays of 1d where both arguments are var int
predicate cp1d(array[int] of var int: x, array[int] of var int: y) =
  assert(index_set(x) = index_set(y),
           "cp1d: x and y have different sizes",
     forall(i in index_set(x)) ( x[i] = y[i] ))
; 


% solve satisfy;
solve :: int_search(x, first_fail, indomain_min, complete) satisfy;

% p is a prime
constraint
   is_prime(p) /\ toNum10(x, p)
;

% """
% A limerick prime has to have the form AABBA where A is an 
% odd digit and B is any digit other than A. 
% """
constraint
   cp1d(x, [A,A,B,B,A])
   /\ 
   A mod 2 = 1
   /\
   A != B
;

output [
  "p: " ++ show(p) ++ "\n" ++
  "x: " ++ show(x)
]
 ++ ["\n"]
;

Expected Output:
{
  "p": 11551,
  "x": [
    1,
    1,
    5,
    5,
    1
  ],
  "A": 1,
  "B": 5
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
