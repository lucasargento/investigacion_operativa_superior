You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 31
- Name: Relief Effort Coordination
- Domain: Transportation and Logistics
- Objective: minimization

Problem Description:
Problem involves coordinating relief efforts after catastrophes by dropping relief packages in locations that minimize the total distance villagers must travel to pick them up. Villager locations are given on a grid, and only air drop options for relief supply delivery are available. Each villager will pick up supplies from the nearest drop location. We can choose exactly 2 airdrop locations and have to minimize the sum of squared distances of huts to their closest relief package destination.


Input Data (data.dzn):
n = 10;
huts = array2d(1..10, 1..10, 
[

% Coordinating relief efforts after catastrophes such as civil unrest and 
% natural disasters can be a logistically complex challenge. Delivering 
% relief to people in need is the immediate focus of any disaster management plan.
% 
% The map in Figure 1 shows the locations of 20 villagers, each represented by 
% a "hut" icon. The villagers are in need of relief supplies contained in 
% the crates attached to parachutes. There are two identical relief packages 
% available. The only delivery option is by air drop. Each package can be dropped 
% on any cell.
% 
% After the crates are dropped, each villager will walk to the nearest drop 
% location to pick up relief supplies. Use a direct line between cells to calculate 
% travel distance. For example, the distance between A1 and A2 is 1km and the 
% distance between A1 to B2 is 1.41 km. Assume that each crate contains an 
% unlimited amount of relief supplies.
% 
% Figure 1: Where should the two relief packages be dropped?

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
