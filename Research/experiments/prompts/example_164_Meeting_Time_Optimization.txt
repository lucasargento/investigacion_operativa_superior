You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 164
- Name: Meeting Time Optimization
- Domain: Scheduling
- Objective: minimization

Problem Description:
Consider a meeting that ran non-stop the whole day. Each person stayed at the meeting for a continuous period of time. The meeting began while Mr Jones was present and finished while Ms White was present. Ms White arrived after the meeting has began. In turn, Director Smith, was also present but he arrived after Jones had left. Mr Brown talked to Ms White in presence of Smith. The problem is to determine if Jones and White could possibly have talked during this meeting. The goal is to minimize the time for Jones and White.


MiniZinc Model:
predicate interval(var int: X1, var int: X2) =
  X1 < X2
;

predicate before(var int: X1, var int: X2, var int: Y1, var int: Y2) =

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.
