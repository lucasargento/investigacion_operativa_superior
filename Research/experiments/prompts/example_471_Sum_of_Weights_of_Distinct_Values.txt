You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 471
- Name: Sum of Weights of Distinct Values
- Domain: Constraints
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
The problem is about a constraint called 'sum_of_weights_of_distinct_values'. This constraint is applied to a collection of variables, a collection of values, and a cost. All variables in the VARIABLES collection take a value in the VALUES collection. In addition, COST is the sum of the weight attributes associated with the distinct values taken by the variables of VARIABLES. For example, if VARIABLES = <1,6,1>, VALUES = <val-1 weight-5, val-2 weight-3, val-6 weight-7>, and COST = 12, the constraint holds since COST=12 is equal to the sum 5+7 of the weights of the values 1 and 6 that occur within the VARIABLES collection. The goal is to find the variables, values, and cost that satisfy this constraint.


MiniZinc Model:
int: n = 3;
int: m = 3;
array[1..n] of var 1..6: variables;
array[1..m, 1..2] of var 1..7: values;
var 1..1000: cost;

predicate sum_of_weights_of_distinct_values(array[int] of var int: variables,
                                            array[int,int] of var int: values,
                                            var int: cost) =
   cost = sum(i in index_set_1of2(values)) (
              values[i,2]*bool2int(exists(j in index_set(variables)) (
                 variables[j] = values[i,1]
              ))
          )

;

predicate cp1d(array[int] of var int: x, array[int] of var int: y) =
  assert(index_set(x) = index_set(y),
           "cp1d: x and y have different sizes",
     forall(i in index_set(x)) ( x[i] = y[i] ))
; 

predicate cp2d(array[int,int] of var int: x, array[int,int] of var int: y) =
  assert(index_set_1of2(x) = index_set_1of2(y) /\
         index_set_2of2(x) = index_set_2of2(y),
           "cp2d: x and y have different sizes",
     forall(i in index_set_1of2(x), j in index_set_2of2(x)) (
         y[i,j] = x[i,j]
    ) 
  )
; 

solve satisfy;

constraint
   cp1d(variables, [1,6,1]) /\
   cost = 12 /\
   cp2d(values, array2d(1..m, 1..2, [
                     1,5,
                     2,3,
                     6,7
                    ]))

   /\
   sum_of_weights_of_distinct_values(variables, values, cost)  
;


output [
"variables: " ++ show(variables) ++ "\n"++
"values: " ++ show(values) ++ "\n"++
"cost: " ++ show(cost) ++ "\n"
];

Expected Output:
{
  "variables": [
    1,
    6,
    1
  ],
  "values": [
    [
      1,
      5
    ],
    [
      2,
      3
    ],
    [
      6,
      7
    ]
  ],
  "cost": 12
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.
