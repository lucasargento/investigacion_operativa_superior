You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 186
- Name: Equal Subset Partition
- Domain: Combinatorial Optimization
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
Given a set of numbers, the problem is to partition the set into two subsets such that the sum of the numbers in each subset is equal. For example, given the set {3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1,5,2,7}, it can be partitioned into two subsets {3,2,7} and {1,1,2,1,5,2} where the sum of each subset is 12. The problem requires determining if such a partition is possible and if so, finding the partition. The problem is solved using a constraint satisfaction approach where each number in the set is assigned to one of the two subsets such that the sum of the numbers in each subset is equal.


MiniZinc Model:
int: n = 9;
int: num_subsets = 2;
array[1..n] of int: s = [3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 5, 2, 7];

% decision variables

% to which subset does x[i] belong
array[1..n] of var 1..num_subsets: x;


solve satisfy;
% solve :: int_search(x, first_fail, indomain_min, complete) satisfy;

% Hardcoded for 2 subsets
% constraint
%    sum([s[i]*bool2int(x[i] == 1) | i in 1..n]) == 
%    sum([s[i]*bool2int(x[i] == 2) | i in 1..n])
%    /\ % symmetry breaking
%    x[1] = 1
% ;

% More general
constraint
   forall(p in 1..num_subsets-1) (
      sum([s[i]*bool2int(x[i] == p) | i in 1..n]) == 
      sum([s[i]*bool2int(x[i] == p+1) | i in 1..n])
   )
;

% symmetry breaking
constraint
   x[1] = 1
;


output [
  "s: " ++ show(s) ++ "\n" ++
  "x: " ++ show(x) ++ "\n"
]
++
[
  "subset" ++ show(j) ++ ": " ++ show([s[i] | i in 1..n where fix(x[i]) == j]) ++ "\n"
  | j in 1..num_subsets
] 
;

Expected Output:
{
  "x": [
    1,
    2,
    2,
    2,
    2,
    2,
    2,
    1,
    1
  ]
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.
