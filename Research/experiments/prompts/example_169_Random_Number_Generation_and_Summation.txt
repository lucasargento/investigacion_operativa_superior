You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 169
- Name: Random Number Generation and Summation
- Domain: Random Number Generation
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
The problem is about generating random problem instances in MiniZinc. The problem is inspired by the Parkâ€“Miller random number generator, which is a simple random number generator (RNG) defined by the recurrence relation x[i+1] = g * x[i] mod n. The problem requires to generate an array of pseudo random elements with a given seed and maximum value. If the maximum value is 0, then no modulo operation is performed. The problem also includes a test constraint that for all i in 1 to n-1, x[i] should be greater than or equal to 0 and the sum of x[i] and x[i+1] should be equal to the sum of the corresponding elements in the random array.


MiniZinc Model:
int: n = 10;
int: max_value = 10;
int: seed = 1;

% decision variables
array[1..n] of var int: rand; % random data

array[1..n] of var int: x;

% array[1..n] of var float: y;


%
% Returns (in r) an array of pseudo random elements with seed 'seed' and
% max_value 'max_value'. If max_value = 0, then no modulo is done in r.
%
% Example:
%    rand_int_array(10, 1, 10, r)
% give the array 
%    r = [1, 9, 4, 9, 3, 9, 2, 10, 6, 9] % seed 1
%
% Different seeds:
% seed = 1: [1, 9, 4, 9, 3, 9, 2, 10, 6, 9]
% seed = 2: [2, 7, 8, 7, 7, 7, 4, 9, 1, 8]
% seed = 3: [3, 5, 1, 6, 0, 5, 6, 8, 7, 7]
% seed = 4: [4, 3, 5, 4, 4, 4, 8, 7, 2, 5]
% seed = 1001: [0, 1, 8, 8, 10, 5, 2, 4, 10, 2]
%
predicate rand_int_array(int: n, int: seed, int: max_value, array[int] of var int: r) =
  let  {
    array[1..n] of var int: rng,

  )
  /\
  forall(i in 1..n) (
    if  max_value > 0 then
       r[i] = rng[i] mod (max_value+1)
    else 
       r[i] = rng[i]
    endif

   /\ % just a silly test

     x[i] >= 0 /\
     x[i+1]+x[i] = (rand[i]+rand[i+1])
   )

output [
  "rand: " ++ show(rand) ++ "\n" ++
  "x   : " ++ show(x) ++ "\n"
  
  % ++ "y  : " ++ show(y) ++ "\n"

Expected Output:
{
  "rand": [
    1,
    9,
    4,
    9,
    3,
    9,
    2,
    10,
    6,
    9
  ],
  "x": [
    0,
    10,
    3,
    10,
    2,
    10,
    1,
    11,
    5,
    10
  ]
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
