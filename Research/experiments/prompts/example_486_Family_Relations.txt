You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 486
- Name: Family Relations
- Domain: Logic
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
The problem is about modeling family relations using MiniZinc. The family database is ported from the book 'Programming with Constraints' by Marriott & Stuckey. The family consists of 9 members, each represented by a unique integer. The family relations are represented as father and mother relations. The father relations are represented as a 2D array of size 6x2, and the mother relations are represented as a 2D array of size 2x2. The age of each family member is also given. The problem defines several predicates to represent different family relations such as father, mother, parent, sibling, and cousin. The problem also defines a predicate to determine if one family member is older than another. The problem is to find a family member X who is a cousin of Peter and is older than Peter.


MiniZinc Model:
int: n = 9;
int: num_father_r = 6;
int: num_mother_r = 2;
set of int: r = 1..n;

r: maggy   = 1;
r: helen   = 2;
r: kitty   = 3;
r: fi      = 4;
r: lillian = 5;
r: jim     = 6;
r: edward  = 7;
r: peter   = 8;
r: bill    = 9;

array[1..num_father_r, 1..2] of r: is_father;
array[1..num_mother_r, 1..2] of r: is_mother;
array[r] of int: age;

var r: X;
var r: Y;


% father
predicate father(var r: f, var r: c) =
  exists(i in 1..num_father_r) (
    is_father[i, 1] = f
    /\ 
    is_father[i,2] = c
  )
;

% mother
predicate mother(var r: m, var r: c) =
  exists(i in 1..num_mother_r) (
     is_mother[i, 1] = m
     /\ 
     is_mother[i,2] = c
  )
;


% parent
predicate parent(var r: p, var r: c) =
   father(p, c) \/ mother(p, c)
;

% sibling
predicate sibling(var r: s1, var r: s2) =
   exists (p in r) (
     parent(p, s1) /\ parent(p, s2)
     /\ 
     s1 != s2
   )
;

% cousin
predicate cousin(var r: c1, var r: c2) =
   exists(p1, p2, p3 in r) (
      parent(p1, c1)
      /\
      parent(p2, c2)
      /\
      sibling(p1, p2)
      /\
      c1 != c2
      /\ 
      p1 != p2
   )
;

% older
predicate older(var r: p1, var r: p2) = 
   age[p1] > age[p2]

    % give all father relations
    % father(X, Y)

    % who is sibling to Peter?
    % X = peter
    % /\
    % sibling(X, Y)

    % who is cousin to Peter?
    cousin(X, Y) % Y -> fi

is_father = array2d(1..6, 1..2, [
        jim,edward,
        jim,maggy,

        edward,helen,
        edward,kitty,
        bill,fi]);

is_mother = array2d(1..2, 1..2, [
        maggy,fi,
        fi,lillian]);


age = [63, 37, 35, 43, 22, 85, 60, 33, 65];


output
[
  "X: " ++ show(X) ++ "\n" ++
  "Y: " ++ show(Y) ++ "\n"
];

Expected Output:
{
  "X": 4,
  "Y": 8
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
