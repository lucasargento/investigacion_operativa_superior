You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 288
- Name: Grocery Store Puzzle
- Domain: Puzzles
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
# Problem Grocery

A kid goes into a grocery store and buys four items.
The cashier charges $7.11, the kid pays and is about to leave when the cashier calls the kid back, and says:
"Hold on, I multiplied the four items instead of adding them;
  I'll try again;
  Hah, with adding them the price still comes to $7.11 ".
What were the prices of the four items?


## Data
  all integrated (single problem)

## Model
  constraints: [Sum](http://pycsp.org/documentation/constraints/Sum)

## Execution

  python Grocery.py
```

MiniZinc Model:
include "globals.mzn";

% Define the variables
var 0..711: item1;
var 0..711: item2;
var 0..711: item3;
var 0..711: item4;

% The sum of the prices of the four items must equal $7.11
constraint item1 + item2 + item3 + item4 = 711;

% The product of the prices of the four items must equal $7.11
constraint item1 * item2 * item3 * item4 = 711000000;

% The prices of the items must be different
constraint alldifferent([item1, item2, item3, item4]);

% Solve the problem
solve satisfy;

% Output the solution
output ["Item 1: " ++ show(item1), "\nItem 2: " ++ show(item2), "\nItem 3: " ++ show(item3), "\nItem 4: " ++ show(item4)];

Expected Output:
{
  "item1": 316,
  "item2": 150,
  "item3": 125,
  "item4": 120
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
