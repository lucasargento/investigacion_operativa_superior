You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 163
- Name: Water Bucket Problem
- Domain: Bin packing and Partitioning
- Objective: minimization

Problem Description:

Title:    Water Bucket Problem 
Proposer: Toby Walsh
Category: 
    - Bin packing
    - Partitioning and related problems

Given the promise of SAT and CSP techniques for solving "classical" planning problems, I decided to propose this puzzle.

You are given an 8 pint bucket of water, and two empty buckets which can contain 5 and 3 pints respectively. You are required to divide the water into two by pouring water between buckets (that is, to end up with 4 pints in the 8 pint bucket, and 4 pints in the 5 pint bucket).

What is the minimum number of transfers of water between buckets? The challenge is to solve this as a planning problem (encoded into satisfiability or constraint satisfaction) with an efficiency approaching (or exceeding) a simple [enumeration](models/enumerate.pl).

int: input_max = 15;
int: initial_state = 1;

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
