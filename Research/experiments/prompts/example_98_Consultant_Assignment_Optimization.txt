You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 98
- Name: Consultant Assignment Optimization
- Domain: Economic and Business Decisions
- Objective: minimization

Problem Description:
A company has several projects to be done by a fixed number of consultants. Each consultant may be assigned up to a maximum number of projects. Hiring consultants incurs a fixed cost and there is an additional cost incurred for assigning specific consultants to specific projects. Determine the assignment of consultants to projects that minimize the total cost.


Input Data (data.dzn):
I = 5;
J = 3;
FixedCosts = [100, 150, 135];
AdditionalCosts = array2d(1..5, 1..3, [10, 12, 20, 10, 8, 12, 15, 8, 20, 10, 6, 15, 8, 10, 15]);
MaxProjectsPerConsultant = 3;


MiniZinc Model:
% Empty model file

Expected Output:
{
  "_objective": 290.0
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
