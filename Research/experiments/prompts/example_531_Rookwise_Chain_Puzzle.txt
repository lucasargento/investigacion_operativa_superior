You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 531
- Name: Rookwise Chain Puzzle
- Domain: Puzzles
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
The problem is a puzzle called the Rookwise chain puzzle. The task is to place the digits from 1 to 9 on a 3x3 matrix in such a way that they form a rookwise connected chain, from 1 to 9. A rookwise chain means that each number is adjacent to the next number in the sequence, either horizontally or vertically, similar to the movements of a rook in chess. Additionally, the numbers should be arranged in such a way that the sum of the numbers in the bottom row is equal to the sum of the numbers in the first two rows. The solution to this puzzle is unique.


MiniZinc Model:
include "globals.mzn"; 
int: n = 3;
array[1..n, 1..n] of var 1..n*n: x;
array[1..n] of var int: row_sums; % sum of the rows

predicate toNum10(array[int] of var int: a, var int: n) =
          let { int: len = length(a) }
          in
          n = sum(i in 1..len) (
            ceil(pow(10.0, int2float(len-i))) * a[i]
          )
          /\ forall(i in 1..len) (a[i] >= 0)
;


% solve satisfy;
solve :: int_search([x[i,j] | i,j in 1..n] ++ row_sums, first_fail, indomain_min, complete) satisfy;


constraint
   forall(i in 1..n) ( 
      row_sums[i] > 0
   )
   /\ 
   all_different([x[i,j] | i,j in 1..n])
   /\ % sum of rows
   forall(i in 1..n) (
      toNum10([x[i,j] | j in 1..n], row_sums[i])
   )
   /\ % sum of first 1..n-1 rows = n'th row
   sum(i in 1..n-1) (row_sums[i]) = row_sums[n]

   /\ % the rook moves
   forall(k in 1..n*n-1) (
     exists(i, j in 1..n) (
        k = x[i, j] % fix this k
        /\
        exists(a, b in {-1, 0, 1}
          where 
          i+a >= 1 /\ j+b >= 1 
          /\
          i+a <= n /\ j+b <= n
          /\ 
          abs(a+b) = 1 % just move in exactly one direction
        ) 
        (
          % find the next k
          k + 1 = x[i+a, j+b]  
        )
     )
  )
;


output 
[
  "\nrow_sums: ", show(row_sums)
] ++
[
  if j = 1 then "\n" else " " endif ++
    show(x[i,j])
  | i, j in 1..n
] ++ ["\n"]
;

Expected Output:
{
  "x": [
    [
      1,
      2,
      9
    ],
    [
      4,
      3,
      8
    ],
    [
      5,
      6,
      7
    ]
  ],
  "row_sums": [
    129,
    438,
    567
  ]
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.
