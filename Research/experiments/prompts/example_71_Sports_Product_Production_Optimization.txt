You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 71
- Name: Sports Product Production Optimization
- Domain: Manufacturing and Production
- Objective: maximization

Problem Description:
Wild Sports produces different products using different raw materials. The company has a specific amount of each raw material available. Each product requires some amount of each raw material to be produced. Each product has a selling price per unit and a production cost. Each product also has a forecasted maximum demand for the month. How many of each product should the sports produce to maximize its profit for the month?


Input Data (data.dzn):
N = 3;
M = 3;
Available = [240000, 8000, 75000];
Requirements = array2d(1..3, 1..3, [48, 1, 10, 40, 1, 10, 0, 1, 2]);
Prices = [40, 38, 9];
Costs = [30, 26, 7];
Demands = [10000, 2000, 10000];


MiniZinc Model:
% Empty model file

Expected Output:
{
  "_objective": 62666.6666667
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
