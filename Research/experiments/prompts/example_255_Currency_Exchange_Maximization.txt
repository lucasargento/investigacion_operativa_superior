You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 255
- Name: Currency Exchange Maximization
- Domain: Finance
- Objective: maximization

Problem Description:
The objective is to maximize the number of units of currency N that we end up with at the end of the day, through a sequence of currency transactions. We start with a certain amount Start for each currency, there is a limit Limit to the number of transactions we can perform for each currency, and the exchange rates are given by Rate.


Input Data (data.dzn):
N = 3;
Start = [100.0, 50.0, 200.0];
Limit = [1000.0, 200.0, 3000.0];
Rate = [|0.99, 0.9, 1.02| 0.95, 0.99, 0.92| 0.9, 0.91, 0.99|];

MiniZinc Model:
% Parameters
int: N; % Number of currencies
array[1..N] of float: Start; % Initial amount of each currency
array[1..N] of float: Limit; % Limit of transactions for each currency
array[1..N, 1..N] of float: Rate; % Exchange rates between currencies

% Decision Variables
array[1..N, 1..N] of var 0.0..Limit[N]: Transactions; % Amount of currency i exchanged to currency j

% Objective
var float: FinalAmount = Start[N] + sum(i in 1..N-1) (Transactions[i,N] * Rate[i,N] - Transactions[N,i] / Rate[N,i]);
maximize FinalAmount;

% Constraints
constraint forall(i in 1..N) (
    sum(j in 1..N) (Transactions[i,j] + Transactions[j,i]) <= Limit[i]
);

constraint forall(i in 1..N, j in 1..N) (
    Transactions[i,j] <= Start[i]
);

constraint forall(i in 1..N, j in 1..N) (
    Transactions[i,j] * Rate[i,j] = Transactions[j,i]
);

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
