You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 380
- Name: Numerica Problem
- Domain: Mathematics
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
This problem is taken from the Numerica book, page 21. The problem is to find two real numbers, x[1] and x[2], such that the following two conditions are satisfied: 1) The sum of the squares of x[1] and x[2] is equal to 1. 2) The square of x[1] is equal to x[2]. The search space for the variables x[1] and x[2] is from -10^8 to 10^8. The problem is to find all solutions that satisfy these conditions. The problem also includes an optional additional constraint that x[1] must be greater than or equal to 0.


MiniZinc Model:
float: v = pow(10.0,8.0);

array[1..2] of var -v..v: x;


% solve satisfy;
solve :: float_search(x, 0.00000000000001, input_order, indomain_split, complete) satisfy;

constraint
   x[1]*x[1] + x[2]*x[2] = 1.0 
   /\
   x[1]*x[1] = x[2]
   
   % additional constraint
   % /\ x[1] >= 0.0
;

output [
  "x:" ++ show(x) ++ "\n"
];

Expected Output:
{
  "x": [
    -0.786151377757423,
    0.618033988749895
  ]
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
