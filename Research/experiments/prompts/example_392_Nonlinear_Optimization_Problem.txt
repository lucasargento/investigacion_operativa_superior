You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 392
- Name: Nonlinear Optimization Problem
- Domain: Operations Research
- Objective: maximization

Problem Description:
This is a nonlinear optimization problem. The problem is to find the values of L, w, and h that maximize the product of w and h (wh), subject to the following constraints: L, w, and h are all non-negative integers; wh is at least 625; the sum of twice w and twice h equals L; L is at most 100; and h is at least 2. The optimal solution, according to Taha's 'Operations Research', is when w equals h equals L/4.


MiniZinc Model:
var int: L; % >= 0;
var int: w; % >= 0;
var int: h; % >= 0;

var int: wh = w*h;

solve maximize wh;
% solve satisfy;

constraint
  L >= 0 /\ w >= 0 /\ h >= 0 /\
  wh >= 625 /\
  L >= 0 /\ w >= 0 /\ h >= 0 /\
  2*(w+h) = L /\
  L <= 100 /\
  h >= 2
;


output 
[
  show([L,w,h,wh]), "\n",
  "[w,h,L/4]: ", show([w,h,L div 4])
];

Expected Output:
{
  "L": 100,
  "w": 25,
  "h": 25,
  "_objective": 625
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
