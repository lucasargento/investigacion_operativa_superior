You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 35
- Name: Timetable Problem
- Domain: Scheduling
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
The Timetable problem involves scheduling lectures for a given number of courses, each comprising a given number of lectures, across a given number of periods. Some courses have conflicts between them and can't be scheduled at the same time. Courses are only available to be scheduled for certain times, and there's a limit on the number of lectures that can be scheduled per period. Each course has a required number of lectures. The objective is to allocate lectures to periods satisfying all constraints.

courses = 5;
periods = 20;
rooms = 2;

available = array2d(1..courses,1..periods,

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.
