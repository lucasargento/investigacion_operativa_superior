You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 59
- Name: Steel Production Optimization
- Domain: Manufacturing and Production
- Objective: maximization

Problem Description:
A company produces different types of steel using different alloys. The company has a certain amount of each alloy available. Steel requires a certain percentage of carbon and has a maximum allowable percentage of nickel. Each alloy contains a percentage of carbon and a percentage of nickel. Each type of alloy also has a purchase price per ton. Each type of steel has a selling price per ton. Additionally, all steel must have at most 40% of alloy 1 in it. How much of each alloy should the company use in each type of steel, and how much of each steel type should be produced to maximize profit?


Input Data (data.dzn):
A = 3;
S = 2;
AvailableAlloy = [40, 50, 80];
CarbonContent = [3, 4, 3.5];
NickelContent = [1, 1.5, 1.8];
AlloyPrice = [380, 400, 440];
SteelPrice = [650, 600];
CarbonMin = [3.6, 3.4];
NickelMax = [1.5, 1.7];


MiniZinc Model:
% Empty model file

Expected Output:
{
  "_objective": 37100.0
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
