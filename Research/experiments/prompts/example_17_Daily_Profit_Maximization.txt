You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 17
- Name: Daily Profit Maximization
- Domain: Economic and Business Decisions
- Objective: maximization

Problem Description:
A company produces several kinds of products. Each product of a given type requires a given number of hours of assembly labor, hours of testing, and raw materials (measured in $). Given the current personnel of the company, there is a limit on the number of hours of assembly labor and hours of testing each day. Each type of product has a price. The company also has an upper limit on the number of hours of overtime assembly labor that can be scheduled at an overtime rate in hours. Suppose that a raw material supplier provides a percentage discount if the daily bill is above a given $ threshold. Maximize the daily profit of the company, which is the total revenue minus the total cost.


Input Data (data.dzn):
N = 2;
AssemblyHour = [0.25, 0.3333];
TestingHour = [0.125, 0.3333];
MaterialCost = [1.2, 0.9];
MaxAssembly = 10;
MaxTesting = 70;
Price = [9, 8];
MaxOvertimeAssembly = 50;
OvertimeAssemblyCost = 5;
MaterialDiscount = 10;
DiscountThreshold = 300;


MiniZinc Model:
% Empty model file

Expected Output:
{
  "_objective": 339000.0
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
