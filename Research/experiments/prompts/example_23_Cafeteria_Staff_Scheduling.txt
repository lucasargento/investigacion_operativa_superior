You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 23
- Name: Cafeteria Staff Scheduling
- Domain: Scheduling
- Objective: minimization

Problem Description:
To operate a cafeteria, the manager must ensure on-call duty based on the statistics on the required staff. For the future days, we know the number of desired employees on each day. If each employee works a fixed number of days in a row followed by a fixed number of days off, calculate the minimum number of employees to hire. Assume a recurring schedule.


Input Data (data.dzn):
N = 6;
Num = [5, 10, 2, 3, 2, 10];
WorkingDays = 5;
RestingDays = 2;

MiniZinc Model:
% Empty model file

Expected Output:
{
  "_objective": 15.0
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
