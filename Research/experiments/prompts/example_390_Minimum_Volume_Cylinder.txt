You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 390
- Name: Minimum Volume Cylinder
- Domain: Mathematics
- Objective: minimization

Problem Description:
The problem is about creating a cylinder. The cylinder's width (W) can be either 50, 100, or 200, and its length (L) can be any integer between 2 and 5. The volume (V) of the cylinder is calculated using the formula V = 1.0*(W/100.0) * (L*L)/(4.0*pi), where pi is approximately 3.1415926535897931. The goal is to find the values of W and L that minimize the volume V, given that V must be greater than or equal to 2.0.


MiniZinc Model:
var {50, 100, 200}: W; 
var 2..5: L; 

var float: V; % the volume to minimize
float: pi = 3.1415926535897931; 

% solve minimize V;
solve :: float_search([V], 0.01, input_order, indomain_split, complete) minimize V;

constraint 
  V >= 2.0 /\
  V = 1.0*(int2float(W)/100.0) * (int2float(L*L)/(4.0*pi))
;

output 
[
  "W: ", show(W), "\n",
  "L: ", show(L), "\n",
  "V: ", show(V), "\n",
];

Expected Output:
{
  "W": 200,
  "L": 4,
  "V": 2.54647908947033,
  "_objective": 2.54647908947033
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
