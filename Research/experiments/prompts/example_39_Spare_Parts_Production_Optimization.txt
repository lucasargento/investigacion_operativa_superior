You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 39
- Name: Spare Parts Production Optimization
- Domain: Manufacturing and Production
- Objective: maximization

Problem Description:
A small firm specializes in making some types of spare automobile parts. Each part has to go through several shops. There is a required number of worker-hours for each type of part in each shop. Making a type of part results in an amount of profit specific to the part. Each shop has a maximum capacity of working hours. How much of each spare part is to be made to maximize profit?


Input Data (data.dzn):
NumParts = 5;
NumMachines = 2;
Time = array2d(1..5, 1..2, [2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1]);
Profit = [30, 20, 40, 25, 10];
Capacity = [700, 1000];


MiniZinc Model:
% Empty model file

Expected Output:
{
  "_objective": 12000.0
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
