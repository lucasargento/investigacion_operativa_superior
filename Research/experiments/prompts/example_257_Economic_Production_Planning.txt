You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 257
- Name: Economic Production Planning
- Domain: Economics
- Objective: maximization

Problem Description:
Maximize the total manpower requirement over five years. The manpower requirements for operations one in year k is ManpowerOne, and for operations two is ManpowerTwo. The stock level of product k at the beginning of the year is Stock, the production capacity for product k for the year is Capacity, and the demand for product k for the year is Demand. The input one coefficient for product k with respect to product j is InputOne, and the input two coefficient for product k with respect to product j is InputTwo.


Input Data (data.dzn):
inputone = array2d(1..3, 1..3, [0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.1, 0.1, 0.5, 0.2, 0.2]);
manpowerone = [0.6, 0.3, 0.2];
inputtwo = array2d(1..3, 1..3, [0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.7, 0.1, 0.1, 0.9, 0.2, 0.2]);
manpowertwo = [0.4, 0.2, 0.1];
stock = [150, 80, 100];
capacity = [300, 350, 280];
demand = [60000000.0, 60000000.0, 30000000.0];

MiniZinc Model:
% Parameters
int: K = 3; % Number of industries
int: T = 5; % Number of years
set of int: INDUSTRIES = 1..K;
set of int: YEARS = 1..T;

% Input data
array[INDUSTRIES, INDUSTRIES] of float: inputone;
array[INDUSTRIES] of float: manpowerone;
array[INDUSTRIES, INDUSTRIES] of float: inputtwo;
array[INDUSTRIES] of float: manpowertwo;
array[INDUSTRIES] of int: stock;
array[INDUSTRIES] of int: capacity;
array[INDUSTRIES] of float: demand;

% Decision variables
array[INDUSTRIES, YEARS] of var 0..capacity[INDUSTRIES]: produce;
array[INDUSTRIES, YEARS] of var 0..capacity[INDUSTRIES]: buildcapa;
array[INDUSTRIES, YEARS] of var 0..capacity[INDUSTRIES]: stockhold;

% Constraints
constraint forall(k in INDUSTRIES, t in YEARS) (
    produce[k, t] + buildcapa[k, t] <= capacity[k]
);

constraint forall(k in INDUSTRIES, t in YEARS) (
    produce[k, t] + stockhold[k, t] >= demand[k]
);

constraint forall(k in INDUSTRIES, t in YEARS diff {1}) (
    stockhold[k, t] = stockhold[k, t-1] + produce[k, t-1] - demand[k]
);

constraint forall(k in INDUSTRIES, t in YEARS diff {1, 2}) (
    capacity[k] = capacity[k] + buildcapa[k, t-2]
);

% Objective function
var float: total_manpower;
constraint total_manpower = sum(k in INDUSTRIES, t in YEARS) (
    produce[k, t]*manpowerone[k] + buildcapa[k, t]*manpowertwo[k]
);
solve maximize total_manpower;

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
