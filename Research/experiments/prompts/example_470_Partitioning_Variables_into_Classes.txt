You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 470
- Name: Partitioning Variables into Classes
- Domain: Combinatorial Optimization
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
The problem is about partitioning a collection of variables into a certain number of classes. The goal is to find the number of partitions of the collection PARTITIONS such that at least one value is assigned to at least one variable of the collection VARIABLES. For example, given the values <3, 2, 7, 2, 6> and the partitions p-<1, 3>, p-<4>, and p-<2, 6>, the values occur within partitions p-<1, 3> and p-<2, 6> but not within p-<4>. Consequently, the nclass constraint holds since its first argument NCLASS is set to value 2. The problem is to find the values of the variables and the partitions that satisfy this constraint.


MiniZinc Model:
include "globals.mzn"; 

int: n = 5;
array[1..n] of var 1..7: x;
var 0..n: num_class;
array[1..3] of var set of 1..7: s;

predicate nclass(var int: nc, 
                 array[int] of var int: v, 
                 array[int] of var set of int: s) =
   all_disjoint(s)
   /\
   num_class = sum(i in index_set(s)) (
     bool2int(
        exists(j in index_set(v)) (
           v[j] in s[i]
        )
     )
   )
;

predicate cp1d(array[int] of var int: x, array[int] of var int: y) =
  assert(index_set(x) = index_set(y),
           "cp1d: x and y have different sizes",
     forall(i in index_set(x)) ( x[i] = y[i] ))
; 

predicate cp1d(array[int] of var set of int: x, array[int] of var set of int: y) =
  assert(index_set(x) = index_set(y),
           "cp1d: x and y have different sizes",
    forall(i in index_set(x)) ( x[i] = y[i] ))
; 

solve satisfy;

constraint
   cp1d(s, [
          {1,3},
          {4},
          {2,6}
       ])
   /\
   cp1d(x, [3,2,7,2,6])
   /\
   num_class = 2
   /\
   nclass(num_class, x, s)
;

output
[
  "x: " ++ show(x) ++ "\n" ++
  "s: " ++ show(s) ++ "\n" ++
  "num_class: " ++ show(num_class)

];

Expected Output:
{
  "x": [
    3,
    2,
    7,
    2,
    6
  ],
  "num_class": 2,
  "s": [
    {
      "set": [
        1,
        3
      ]
    },
    {
      "set": [
        4
      ]
    },
    {
      "set": [
        2,
        6
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.
