You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 550
- Name: Integer Programming Problem
- Domain: Optimization
- Objective: maximization

Problem Description:
This is a simple integer programming problem. The goal is to maximize the expression 5*smallset + 20*largeset. The variables smallset and largeset are both integers and must be greater than or equal to 0. There are two constraints: 1*smallset + 3*largeset must be less than or equal to 200, and 3*smallset + 2*largeset must be less than or equal to 160. The output should display the values of smallset and largeset.


MiniZinc Model:
var int: smallset;
var int: largeset;

solve maximize 5*smallset + 20*largeset;

constraint
  smallset >= 0 /\ largeset >= 0 
  /\
  1*smallset + 3*largeset <= 200
  /\
  3*smallset + 2*largeset <= 160
;

output
[
  "smallset: " ++ show(smallset) ++ "\n" ++
  "largeset: " ++ show(largeset) ++ "\n"
];

Expected Output:
{
  "smallset": 2,
  "largeset": 66,
  "_objective": 1330
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
