You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 400
- Name: City Infrastructure Investment Optimization
- Domain: Finance
- Objective: maximization

Problem Description:
The mayor has a budget of up to $ 3500 to invest in city infrastructure . He can invest his money on roads and housing . Each dollar invested in housing yields a $ 0.95 profit .   Each dollar invested on roads yields a $ 0.32 profit . No less than $ 750 must be in housing and no less than 24 % of all money invested must be in roads . Formulate an LP that can be used to maximize total profit earned from his investment .


MiniZinc Model:
var int: housing;
var int: roads;
var int: total_investment;

constraint total_investment = housing + roads;
constraint total_investment <= 3500;
constraint housing >= 750;
constraint roads >= 0.24 * total_investment;

var float: profit;

constraint profit = 0.95 * housing + 0.32 * roads;

solve maximize profit;

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
