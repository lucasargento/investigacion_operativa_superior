You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 14
- Name: Stock Portfolio Optimization
- Domain: Finance and Investment
- Objective: maximization

Problem Description:
An investor has a portfolio of various stocks. He starts with some shares of each stock that he bought at existing prices. The investor knows the current price of each share and the expected price that each share will go to after one year. If he sells shares, the investor pays transaction costs, which are a percentage of the amount transacted. In addition, the investor pays taxes, as a percentage of earnings, on capital gains (i.e., the difference between the amount received from selling shares and the amount paid to buy them). The investor wants to raise an amount of money net of capital gains and transaction costs. You can assume that the investor can sell floating point numbers of shares. How many shares does the investor need to sell to raise the needed money, net of capital gains and transaction costs, while maximizing the expected value of his portfolio next year?


Input Data (data.dzn):
N = 3;
Bought = [100, 150, 80];
BuyPrice = [50, 40, 30];
CurrentPrice = [60, 35, 32];
FuturePrice = [65, 44, 34];
TransactionRate = 1.0;
TaxRate = 15.0;
K = 5000;


MiniZinc Model:
% Empty model file

Expected Output:
{
  "_objective": 10305.11226
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
