You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 177
- Name: Checkers Placement
- Domain: Combinatorial Optimization
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
The problem is about placing n checkers on an (n x n) checkers board with the following restrictions: 
1) In each column there is EXACTLY one checker. 
2) For i=1,2,...,(n-1), the first i rows cannot have EXACTLY i checkers. 
The goal is to count the number of ways to do so. The hypothesis is that the answer is n^{n-1}, but it needs to be proven. If restriction 2) is removed, the answer is obviously n^n. The problem also involves finding the number of different row patterns for different values of n. The patterns seem to follow the Catalan numbers.


Input Data (data.dzn):
n = 4;

MiniZinc Model:
int: n = 4;

% comment the output for counting larger values of n
array[1..n, 1..n] of var 0..1: x;
array[1..n] of var 0..n: sum_rows;

solve :: int_search([x[i,j] | i,j in 1..n] ++ sum_rows, first_fail, indomain_min, complete) satisfy;

constraint

  % We are going to put n checkers on an (n x n) checkers board, 
  sum([x[i,j] | i,j in 1..n]) = n

  /\ % In each column there is EXACTLY one checker.
  forall(j in 1..n) (
      sum([x[i,j] | i in 1..n]) = 1
  )

  /\ % For i=1,2,...,(n-1), the first i rows cannot have EXACTLY i checkers.
  forall(i in 1..n) (
    % number of checker on each row 
    sum_rows[i] = sum([x[i,j] | j in 1..n])
  )
  /\
  forall(i in 1..n-1) (
      sum([sum_rows[j] | j in 1..i]) != i
  ) 
;

output 
[
  "sum_rows: " ++ show(sum_rows) ++ "\n"
] 
++
[
  if j = 1 then  "\n" else " " endif ++
    show(x[i,j])
  | i, j in 1..n
]
++ 
["\n"];

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
