Title:    Maximum Clique
Proposer: Ciaran McCreesh
Category: Combinatorial mathematics

Given a simple undirected graph $G = (V,E)$, where $V$ is the set of vertices
and $E$ the set of undirected edges, a clique is a subset of $V$ such that each
distinct pair of vertices in this subset are adjacent. The maximum clique
problem is to find a clique of largest cardinality within a given graph. (The
related clique enumeration problem is to enumerate all maximal cliques---that
is, cliques which cannot be extended by adding an additional vertex.)

The second DIMACS implementation challenge studied this problem, and provided a
standard set of benchmark instances in a simple file format. These instances
are of varying size and difficulty: some should be trivial, but a few are still
open. A simple example of a file is:

<pre>
c Lines that start with a c are comments. There is one line at the start
c which starts with either "p edge" or "p col", followed by the number of
c vertices and the (possibly incorrect) number of edges. The e lines each
c describe an edge. Some files have blank lines.
p edge 5 6
e 1 2
e 2 3
e 3 4
e 4 1
e 3 5
e 4 5
</pre>

This describes a graph with 5 vertices (which are numbered 1 to 5) and 6 edges.
The edges number is *not reliable* and should be ignored. Some instances
include (some) edges in both directions, whilst others do not. Some files
contain loops (vertices adjacent to themselves), which should be ignored for
the clique problem.

The maximum clique in this file has size 3, with vertices 3, 4 and 5.

Other datasets are available, also using this format.

The maximum clique problem is equivalent to the maximum independent set problem
and the vertex cover problem. It is also used as an intermediate step in
solving the maximum common subgraph problem.


MiniZinc Model:
int: n = 5;
array[1..n, 1..n] of int: adj =
    [| 0, 1, 0, 1, 0
     | 1, 0, 1, 0, 0
     | 0, 1, 0, 1, 1
     | 1, 0, 1, 0, 1
     | 0, 0, 1, 1, 0 |];

% --- naive model ---

% decision variables: which vertices are in the clique?
array[1..n] of var bool: c;
var int: size;

% how many vertices have we selected?
constraint size = sum(c);

% we can only pick one of any non-adjacent pair of vertices
constraint forall (i, j in 1..n where i < j /\ 0 == adj[i,j]) (bool2int(c[i]) + bool2int(c[j]) <= 1);

solve maximize size;

Expected Output:
{
  "c": [
    false,
    false,
    true,
    true,
    true
  ],
  "size": 3,
  "_objective": 3
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
