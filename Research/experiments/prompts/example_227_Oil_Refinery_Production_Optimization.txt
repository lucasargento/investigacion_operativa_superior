You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 227
- Name: Oil Refinery Production Optimization
- Domain: Industrial Engineering
- Objective: maximization

Problem Description:
We want to know how many times should we execute each process to maximize the revenue for the next month (you can assume that the number of times that each process is executed is a floating point number). The problem involves O options, P price points, and L processes with Allocated resources, Price at each price point, Input required for each option in each process, Output produced for each price point in each process, and Cost for each process.


Input Data (data.dzn):
O = 2;
P = 2;
L = 3;
Allocated = [8000, 5000];
Price = [38, 33];
Input = [|3, 5|, |1, 1|, |5, 3|];
Output = [|4, 3|, |1, 1|, |3, 4|];
Cost = [51, 11, 40];

MiniZinc Model:
% Parameters
int: O; % Number of options
int: P; % Number of price points
int: L; % Number of processes
array[1..O] of float: Allocated; % Allocated resources for each option
array[1..P] of float: Price; % Price at each price point
array[1..L, 1..O] of float: Input; % Input required for each option in each process
array[1..L, 1..P] of float: Output; % Output produced for each price point in each process
array[1..L] of float: Cost; % Cost for each process

% Variables
array[1..L] of var 0.0..1000000.0: Execute; % Number of times each process is executed
var 0.0..1000000000.0: Revenue; % Total revenue

% Constraints
constraint forall(i in 1..O)(
    sum(l in 1..L)(Input[l,i]*Execute[l]) <= Allocated[i]
);

constraint forall(l in 1..L)(
    sum(p in 1..P)(Output[l,p]*Price[p]) >= Cost[l]*Execute[l]
);

% Objective
var float: totalRevenue = sum(l in 1..L, p in 1..P)(Output[l,p]*Price[p]*Execute[l]) - sum(l in 1..L)(Cost[l]*Execute[l]);
constraint Revenue = totalRevenue;

% Solve
solve maximize Revenue;

% Output
output ["revenue: ", show(Revenue), "\nexecute: ", show(Execute)];

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
