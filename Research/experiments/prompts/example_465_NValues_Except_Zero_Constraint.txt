You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 465
- Name: NValues Except Zero Constraint
- Domain: Constraint Programming
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
The problem is about implementing the global constraint nvalues_except_0 in MiniZinc. The constraint nvalues_except_0(VARIABLES,RELOP,LIMIT) is defined as follows: Let N be the number of distinct values, different from 0, assigned to the variables of the VARIABLES collection. The condition N RELOP LIMIT should hold. Here, VARIABLES is a collection of variables, RELOP is a comparison operator, and LIMIT is a limit value. The comparison operator is coded as: '<' is -2, '<=' is -1, '=' is 0, '>=' is 1, '>' is 2. An example of this constraint is (<4,5,5,4,0,1>,=,3). The nvalues_except_0 constraint holds since the number of distinct values, different from 0, occurring within the collection <4,5,5,4,0,1> is equal (i.e., RELOP is set to =) to its third argument LIMIT=3. The problem is to find the variables, relop, and limitx that satisfy this constraint.


MiniZinc Model:
int: n = 6;
array[1..n] of var 0..n: variables; 
var 1..n: limitx;
-2..2: relop = 0; % the comparison operator


%
% nvalues_except_0: counts the different values (except 0) in array x
% 
% Since MiniZinc don't handle relational operators (e.g. <, = , >) as 
% arguments in  predicates, we use a method of coding these operators as:
%
%   <  : -2 
%   <= : -1
%    = :  0
%   >= :  1
%   >  :  2
% 
% Note: If relop is not 0 (=) and nv not fixed with '=', then more 
% than one solutions for the same x may be generated. 
% This may be considered a bug or a feature.
%
predicate nvalues_except_0(array[int] of var int: x, int: relop, var int: nv) = 
  let {
     var set of lb_array(x)..ub_array(x): s
  }
  in
  forall(i in lb_array(x)..lb_array(x)) (
    (not exists(j in index_set(x)) (x[j] != 0 /\ x[j] = i ) <-> not (i in s))
  )
  /\
  if relop = -2     then 
     card(s) < nv 
  elseif relop = -1 then
     card(s) <= nv
  elseif relop = 0  then
     card(s) = nv 
  elseif relop = 1  then
     card(s) >= nv
  elseif relop = 2  then
     card(s) > nv 
  else
     false
  endif
;

predicate cp1d(array[int] of var int: x, array[int] of var int: y) =
  assert(index_set(x) = index_set(y),
           "cp1d: x and y have different sizes",
     forall(i in index_set(x)) ( x[i] = y[i] ))
; 

solve satisfy;

constraint

  limitx = 3 /\
  cp1d(variables, [4,5,5,4,0,1]) /\
  nvalues_except_0(variables, relop, limitx)

  % /\ testing when variables is free
  % sum(i in index_set(variables)) (bool2int(variables[i] = 0)) = 3

;


output [
"variables: " ++ show(variables) ++ "\n"++
"relop: " ++ show(relop) ++ "\n"++
"limitx: " ++ show(limitx) ++ "\n"
];

Expected Output:
{
  "variables": [
    4,
    5,
    5,
    4,
    0,
    1
  ],
  "limitx": 3
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.
