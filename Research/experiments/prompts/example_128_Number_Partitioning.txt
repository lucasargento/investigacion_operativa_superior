Title:    Number Partitioning
Proposer: Daniel Diaz
Category: Combinatorial mathematics

This problem consists in finding a partition of numbers $1..N$ into two sets A and B such that:

1. A and B have the same cardinality
2. sum of numbers in $A$ = sum of numbers in $B$
3. sum of squares of numbers in $A$ = sum of squares of numbers in $B$

There is no solution for $N < 8$.

Here is an example for$ N = 8$:$ A = (1,4,6,7)$ and $B = (2,3,5,8)$

Then from $N \>= 8$, there is no solution if $N$ is not a multiple of $4$.

### Generalisation

More constraints can thus be added, e.g also impose the equality on the sum of cubes, ...

Let $C_k$ be the constraint about the power $k$ defined as the equality :

$\Sigma_{i=1}^{N/2} A_i^k = \Sigma_{i=1}^{N/2} B_i^k$

Condition (a) corresponds to $k=0$. Condition (b) to $k=1$. Condition (c) to $k=2$.

This generalized problem can be seen as a conjunction of constraints $C_k$ until a power P $(C_0 /\\ C_1 /\\ ... /\\ C_P)$. The above problem corresponds to $P = 2$.

Empirically, I played with $P = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4$:

The sums of powers is known :

-   $\Sigma_{i=1}^{N} i^0 = N$
-   $\Sigma_{i=1}^{N} i^1 = N \* (N+1) / 2$
-   $\Sigma_{i=1}^{N} i^2 = N \* (N+1) \* (2\*N + 1) / 6$
-   $\Sigma_{i=1}^{N} i^3 = N^2 \* (N+1)^2 / 4$
-   $\Sigma_{i=1}^{N} i^4 = N \* (N+1) \* (6\*N^3 + 9\*N^2 + N - 1) / 30$


Recall in our case we need the half sums. The problem has no solution if the above sums are not even numbers. For P = 0 this implies N is a multiple of 2 (groups A and B have the same cardinality). For P = 1 (knowing N is multiple of 2 due to P = 0) then N \* (N + 1) / 2 is even iff N is multiple of 4.

Here are the first solutions computed:

-   $P = 0$: first solutions found for $N = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, ...$ (obviously for every multiple of 2)
-   $P = 1$: first solutions found for $N = 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32$ (then for every multiple of 4 ?)
-   $P = 2$: first solutions found for $N = 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36$ (then for every multiple of 4 ?)
-   $P = 3$: first solutions found for$ N = 16, 24, 32, 40 $(then for every multiple of 8 ?)
-   $P = 4$: first solutions found for$ N = 32, 40, 48, 56, 64$ (then forevery multiple of 8 ?)

From these tests, it seems the smallest N for which a solution exists is $2^{P+1}$. Can this be proved ?

After that, it seems there are only solutions for N multiple of 2 (P= 0), 4 (P = 1 or 2), 8 (P = 3 or 4). Is this a constant depending on P ?

Another way to generalize this problem consists in increasing the numbers of groups (for instance consider 3 groups A, B, C).

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.
