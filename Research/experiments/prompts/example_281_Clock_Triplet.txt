You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 281
- Name: Clock Triplet
- Domain: Academic
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
# Problem ClockTriplet

The problem was originally posed by Dean Clark and then presented to a larger audience by Martin Gardner.
The problem was discussed in Dr. Dobbs's Journal, May 2004 in an article  by Timothy Rolfe.
According to the article, in his August 1986 column for Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine,
Martin Gardner presented this problem:
  Now for a curious little combinatorial puzzle involving the twelve numbers on the face of a clock.
  Can you rearrange the numbers (keeping them in a circle) so no triplet of adjacent numbers has a sum higher
  than 21? This is the smallest value that the highest sum of a triplet can have.

Timothy Rolfe solves the problem using a rather complex algorithm and also presents a generic algorithm
for numbers other than 12 (clock numbers) and 21 (highest sums of triplets).
The main emphasis of the algorithm was put on the computational speed.
The article stressed the fact that a simple backtracking algorithm would be simply too slow
due to the number of permutations.

MiniZinc Model:
include "globals.mzn";

% Define the parameters
int: r = 21; % Maximum sum of triplets
int: n = 12; % Number of clock numbers

% Define the decision variables
array[1..n] of var 1..n: clock_numbers;

% Define the constraints
constraint alldifferent(clock_numbers);

% Ensure that no three adjacent numbers have a sum exceeding r
constraint forall(i in 1..n-2)(clock_numbers[i] + clock_numbers[i+1] + clock_numbers[(i+2 mod n) + 1] <= r);

% Ensure that the last two numbers and the first number do not exceed r
constraint clock_numbers[n-1] + clock_numbers[n] + clock_numbers[1] <= r;
constraint clock_numbers[n] + clock_numbers[1] + clock_numbers[2] <= r;

% Define the objective function
solve satisfy;

% Output the solution
output ["Clock Numbers: " ++ show(clock_numbers)];

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
