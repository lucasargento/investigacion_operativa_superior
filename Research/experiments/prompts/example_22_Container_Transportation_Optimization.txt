You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 22
- Name: Container Transportation Optimization
- Domain: Transportation and Logistics
- Objective: minimization

Problem Description:
An Italian transport company must send empty containers from its depots to ports. Each depot has a certain number of containers currently available and a requirement on the minimum number of containers it must have. Transporting containers from one depot to another is by barges and each barge can only hold two containers. The cost of the barge is proportional to the distance traveled (we are given the constant of proportionality). If we are given the distances between depots, minimize the total transportation cost to satisfy all requirements.


Input Data (data.dzn):
D = 3;
P = 3;
Numdepot = [3, 3, 4];
Numport = [1, 6, 3];
Price = 3.0;
Distance = array2d(1..3, 1..3, [0.0, 2.0, 5.0, 2.0, 0.0, 3.0, 5.0, 3.0, 0.0]);


MiniZinc Model:
% Empty model file

Expected Output:
{
  "_objective": 9.0
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
