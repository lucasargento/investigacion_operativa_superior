You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 41
- Name: Soybean Transportation Optimization
- Domain: Transportation and Logistics
- Objective: minimization

Problem Description:
US soybean suppliers ship soybeans to different destinations using various routes. Consider a transportation network consisting of several cities. Soybeans are sent from a terminal city to a port city. Subsequently, Soybeans are transported from a port city to a destination city. We are given a set of routes between cities and a positive transport cost per metric ton to transport soybeans per ton along that route. Each source terminal has a soybean supply and each destination has a demand for soybeans that must be met. What quantity of soybeans should they transport along each route from source to destination to minimize transportation costs?


Input Data (data.dzn):
NumTerminals = 3;
NumPorts = 4;
Cost = array2d(1..3, 1..4, [34, 49, 17, 26, 52, 64, 23, 14, 20, 28, 12, 17]);
Demand = [65, 70, 50, 45];
Supply = [150, 100, 100];


MiniZinc Model:
% Empty model file

Expected Output:
{
  "_objective": 33960.0
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
