You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 175
- Name: Langford's Number Problem
- Domain: Combinatorial
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
Langford's number problem (CSP lib problem 24) involves arranging 2 sets of positive integers 1..k into a sequence. The condition for the sequence is that, following the first occurrence of an integer i, each subsequent occurrence of i, appears i+1 indices later than the last. For example, for k=4, a solution would be 41312432. The problem also includes a constraint that k mod 4 = 0 or k mod 4 = 3. The goal is to find a sequence that satisfies these conditions. The solution is represented as an array where the numbers are in their proper positions.


MiniZinc Model:
include "globals.mzn";

int: k;
set of int: positionDomain = 1..2*k;

array[positionDomain] of var positionDomain: position;
% better presentation:
array[positionDomain] of var 1..k: solution;

solve :: int_search(
        position, 
        first_fail, 
        indomain_min, 
        complete) satisfy;

constraint 
    assert( k mod 4 == 0 \/ k mod 4 = 3, "k mod 4 = 0 or k mod 4 = 3")
;

constraint
  forall(i in 1..k) (
     position[i+k] = position[i] + i+1 /\
     % hakank: added this
     solution[position[i]] = i /\ 
     solution[position[k+i]] = i
  )
  /\   
  all_different(position)
  /\ % symmetry breaking
  solution[1] < solution[2*k]
;


output [
  % "position: ", show(position), "\n",
  "solution: ", show(solution), "\n"
];

%
% data
%


% k mod 4 = 0 \/ k mod 4 = 3
%
k = 4;
% k = 7;
% k = 8;
% k = 11;
% k = 12;
% k = 15;
% k = 16;
% k = 19;
% k = 20;
% k = 23;
% k = 24;
% k = 27;
% k = 35;

Expected Output:
{
  "position": [
    5,
    1,
    2,
    3,
    7,
    4,
    6,
    8
  ],
  "solution": [
    2,
    3,
    4,
    2,
    1,
    3,
    1,
    4
  ]
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
