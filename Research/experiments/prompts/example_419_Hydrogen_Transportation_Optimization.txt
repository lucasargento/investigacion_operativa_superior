You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 419
- Name: Hydrogen Transportation Optimization
- Domain: Logistics
- Objective: minimization

Problem Description:
A chemical company is transporting their hydrogen using two different methods , high pressure tube trailers and liquefied hydrogen tankers . The first method is a high - pressure tube trailer which can transport 50 cubic meters each per trip at a cost of $ 500 . The second method is using liquefied hydrogen tankers which can transport 30 cubic meters each per trip at a cost of $ 200 . The company needs to transport at least 1000 cubic meters of hydrogen and they have budget of $ 3750 available . In addition , the number of transports done by the high pressure tube trailer method has to be less than the number of transports done by the liquefied hydrogen tanker method . How many of each transportation method should they use to minimize the total number of trips ?


MiniZinc Model:
var int: tube_trailers;
% number of trips by hydrogen tanker
var int: hydrogen_tankers;

% trips are non-negative
constraint tube_trailers >= 0;
constraint hydrogen_tankers >= 0;

% the company needs to transport at least 1000 cubic meters of hydrogen
% high-pressure tube trailer can transport 50 cubic meters each per trip and hydrogen_tankers 30 cubic meters per trip
constraint tube_trailers * 50 + hydrogen_tankers * 30 >= 1000;
% they have budget of $ 3750 available
% cost of trip is 500 per tube trailer and 200 per hydrogen tanker
constraint tube_trailers * 500 + hydrogen_tankers * 200 <= 3750;

% the number of transports done by the high pressure tube trailer method has to be less than the number of transports done by the liquefied hydrogen tanker method
constraint tube_trailers < hydrogen_tankers;

% minimize total number of trips
solve minimize tube_trailers + hydrogen_tankers;

% output
output ["High Pressure Tube Trailers: " ++ show(tube_trailers) ++ "\nLiquefied Hydrogen Tankers: " ++ show(hydrogen_tankers)];

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
