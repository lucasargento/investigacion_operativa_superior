You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 179
- Name: Order M Quasigroup
- Domain: Mathematics
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
The problem is about finding an order m quasigroup, which is an mxm multiplication table of integers 1..m, where each element occurs exactly once in each row and column and certain multiplication axioms hold. In this case, the axiom 6 should hold, which is defined as (a*b)*b = a*(a*b). The constraints of the problem are: all rows and columns of the quasigroup must be different, the quasigroup must satisfy the multiplication axiom 6, the quasigroup must be idempotent (i.e., a*a = a for all a), and there are some symmetry-breaking constraints. The goal is to find a quasigroup that satisfies all these constraints.


MiniZinc Model:
include "globals.mzn"; 

int: n;
set of int: nDomain = 0..n-1;

array[nDomain, nDomain] of var nDomain: quasiGroup;
array[nDomain, nDomain] of var nDomain: quasiGroupColumns;

% solve satisfy;
solve :: int_search([quasiGroup[row, col] | row, col in nDomain], 
        first_fail, indomain_min, complete) satisfy;

constraint
     
     % assign the "reflected" quasigroup to qGColumns to access its columns
     forall(row,col in nDomain) (
         quasiGroupColumns[col,row] = quasiGroup[row,col]
     )
     /\
     % All rows have to be different
     forall(row in nDomain) (
          all_different([quasiGroup[row, col] | col in nDomain])
     )
     /\
     % All cols have to be different
     forall(col in nDomain) (
          all_different([quasiGroup[row, col] | row in nDomain])
     )
     /\
     % All columns have to be different	       
     forall(col in nDomain) (
          all_different([quasiGroupColumns[row, col] | row in nDomain])
     )
     /\
     % All rows have to be different	       
     forall(row in nDomain) (
          all_different([quasiGroupColumns[row, col] | col in nDomain])
     )
     /\
     % this strange constraint
     % corresponds to:
     % quasiGroup[i, quasiGroup[i,j]] = quasiGroup[quasiGroup[i,j], j]	
     forall(i,j in nDomain) (
         quasiGroup[i, quasiGroup[i,j]] = quasiGroupColumns[j,quasiGroup[i,j]]
     )
     /\
     % Implied constraint: Idempotency
     forall(i in nDomain) (
          quasiGroup[i,i] = i
     )
     /\
     % Symmetry-breaking constraints	
     forall(i in nDomain) (
           quasiGroup[i,n-1] + 2 >= i
     )
;

output 
[ "\nquasiGroupColumns: "
] ++
[
   if col = 0 then "\n" else " " endif ++
    show(quasiGroupColumns[row, col])
  | row, col in nDomain

] ++
[ "\nquasiGroup: "
] ++
[
  if col = 0 then "\n" else " " endif ++
    show(quasiGroup[row, col])
  | row, col in nDomain
] ++ ["\n"];

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.
