You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 224
- Name: Power Plant Electricity Distribution
- Domain: Energy
- Objective: minimization

Problem Description:
How much electricity should each power plant send to each city to minimize the total transmission cost, given there are P power plants with a supply capacity of Supply, C cities with a demand of Demand, and the transmission costs between power plants and cities are TransmissionCosts?


Input Data (data.dzn):
supply = [30, 25, 45];
demand = [40, 60];
transmission_costs = [|14, 22|18, 12|10, 16|];

MiniZinc Model:
% Parameters
int: P; % Number of power plants
int: C; % Number of cities
array[1..P] of int: supply; % Supply capacity of each power plant
array[1..C] of int: demand; % Demand of each city
array[1..P, 1..C] of int: transmission_costs; % Transmission costs between power plants and cities

% Decision Variables
array[1..P, 1..C] of var 0..max(supply): send; % Amount of electricity each power plant sends to each city

% Objective
var int: total_cost; % Total transmission cost

% Constraints
constraint forall(p in 1..P)(sum(c in 1..C)(send[p,c]) <= supply[p]); % Supply capacity constraint
constraint forall(c in 1..C)(sum(p in 1..P)(send[p,c]) = demand[c]); % Demand constraint

% Objective function
constraint total_cost = sum(p in 1..P, c in 1..C)(send[p,c] * transmission_costs[p,c]);

% Solve
solve minimize total_cost;

% Output
output ["send = ", show2d(send), "\n", "total_cost = ", show(total_cost)];

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
