You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 463
- Name: Distinct Intervals Assignment
- Domain: Mathematics
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
The problem is about enforcing all variables of a collection to belong to distinct intervals. The intervals are defined by [SIZE_INTERVAL*k, SIZE_INTERVAL*k+SIZE_INTERVAL-1] where k is an integer. For example, if we have a collection of variables (2,3,10) and SIZE_INTERVAL=3, it defines the following family of intervals [3*k, 3*k+2], where k is an integer. Since the three variables of the collection take values that are respectively located within the three following distinct intervals [0, 2], [3, 5] and [9, 11], the alldifferent_interval constraint holds. The problem is to find such intervals for a given collection of variables and a SIZE_INTERVAL.


MiniZinc Model:
include "globals.mzn"; 

int: n = 3;
array[1..n] of var 1..10: x;
array[1..n, 1..2] of var 0..10*2: intervals;
var 1..9: size_interval;


%
% alldifferent_interval(VARIABLES, SIZE_INTERVAL, INTERVALS)
%
predicate alldifferent_interval(array[int] of var int: variables, 
                                var int: size_interval, 
                                array[int, int] of var int: intervals) =
  let {
     int: lbx = min(index_set(variables)),
     int: ubx = max(index_set(variables))
  } 
  in
  all_different(variables)

  /\ % interval[i] > interval[i-1]
   forall(i in lbx+1..ubx) (  
     intervals[i,1] > intervals[i-1,2]
  )
  /\ % assure the size of interval 
     % and check that x[i] is in the i'th interval
  forall(i in lbx..ubx) (  
    intervals[i, 2] - intervals[i, 1] = size_interval - 1
    /\
    variables[i] >= intervals[i, 1]
    /\
    variables[i] <= intervals[i, 2]      
  )
  /\ % get the k
  exists(k in lbx..ubx) (
    intervals[k, 1] = size_interval*k
    /\
    intervals[k, 2] = size_interval*k+size_interval-1
  )
;

predicate cp1d(array[int] of int: x, array[int] of var int: y) =
  assert(index_set(x) = index_set(y),
           "cp1d: x and y have different sizes",
    forall(i in index_set(x)) (
       x[i] = y[i]
    )
  )
; 


solve satisfy;
% solve :: int_search(x, first_fail, indomain_min, complete) satisfy;

constraint
  cp1d([2, 3, 10],x)
  /\
  alldifferent_interval(x, size_interval, intervals)
  %/\ 
  %size_interval = 3
;


output [
  "x: " ++ show(x) ++ "\n" ++
  "size_interval: " ++ show(size_interval) ++ "\n" ++
  "intervals: " ++ show(intervals) ++ "\n"
];

Expected Output:
{
  "x": [
    2,
    3,
    10
  ],
  "intervals": [
    [
      0,
      2
    ],
    [
      3,
      5
    ],
    [
      9,
      11
    ]
  ],
  "size_interval": 3
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.
