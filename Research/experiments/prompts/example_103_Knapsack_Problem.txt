You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 103
- Name: Knapsack Problem
- Domain: Mathematical Modeling
- Objective: maximization

Problem Description:
The knapsack problem has a significant place in the study of integer programming models with binary variables. In the knapsack problem, one needs to pack a set of items in a container. Each item has a value and a size. The container has a maximum capacity and if the total size of the items exceeds the capacity we can't pack them all. In this case, we need to choose a subset of the items of maximum total value that will fit in the container.



Input Data (data.dzn):
C = 10;
Value = [10, 20];
Size = [8, 6];


MiniZinc Model:
% Empty model file

Expected Output:
{
  "_objective": 20.0
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
