You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 409
- Name: Meat Processing Plant Optimization
- Domain: Manufacturing
- Objective: maximization

Problem Description:
A meat processing plant has a machine that makes ham and bacon . Each kg of ham takes 15 minutes of machine time and each kg of bacon takes 8 minutes of machine time .   In a week the machine is only available for 2000 minutes . The plant can also make at most 200 kg of ham and at most 220 kg of bacon per week . If the profit per kg of ham is $ 20 and the profit per kg of bacon is $ 12 , how many of each should the plant make to maximize profit ?


MiniZinc Model:
var int: ham; 
% number of kgs of bacon
var int: bacon; 

% kgs of ham and bacon produced must be non-negative
constraint ham >= 0;
constraint bacon >= 0;

% total machine time available is 2000
% each kg of ham takes 15 minutes of machine time and each kg of bacon takes 8 minutes of machine time
constraint 15 * ham + 8 * bacon <= 2000; 

% profit per kg of ham is $20 and for bacon is $12
var int: profit = 20 * ham + 12 * bacon; 

% maximize profit
solve maximize profit; 

output ["ham=", show(ham), "\n", "bacon=", show(bacon), "\n", "profit=", show(profit)];

Expected Output:
{
  "ham": 0,
  "bacon": 250,
  "_objective": 3000
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
