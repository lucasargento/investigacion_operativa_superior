You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 32
- Name: Bounds on Fourth Moment
- Domain: Mathematical Modeling
- Objective: maximization

Problem Description:
Suppose that Z is a random variable taking values 0, 1, ..., K, with probabilities p_0, p_1, ..., p_K, respectively. We are given the values of the first two moments of Z:

E[Z] = \sum_{k=0}^{K} k p_k 
E[Z^2] = \sum_{k=0}^{K} k^2 p_k 

We would like to obtain upper and lower bounds on the value of the fourth moment of Z:

E[Z_4] = \sum_{k=0}^{K} k^4 p_k
 		
Use linear programming to find the upper bound on \param{E[Z^4]}.


Input Data (data.dzn):
K = 6;
P = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1];
ExpectedZ = 3;
ExpectedZSquared = 10;

MiniZinc Model:
% Empty model file

Expected Output:
{
  "_objective": 150.0
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
