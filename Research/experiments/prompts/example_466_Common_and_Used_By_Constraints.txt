You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 466
- Name: Common and Used By Constraints
- Domain: Constraint Satisfaction
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
The problem is defined by two constraints: 'common' and 'used_by'. The 'common' constraint is defined as follows: Given two collections of variables, VARIABLES1 and VARIABLES2, NCOMMON1 is the number of variables in VARIABLES1 taking a value in VARIABLES2, and NCOMMON2 is the number of variables in VARIABLES2 taking a value in VARIABLES1. For example, if VARIABLES1 is <1, 9, 1, 5> and VARIABLES2 is <2, 1, 9, 9, 6, 9>, then NCOMMON1 is 3 (the number of values in VARIABLES1 that occur in VARIABLES2) and NCOMMON2 is 4 (the number of values in VARIABLES2 that occur in VARIABLES1). The 'used_by' constraint is defined as follows: All the values of the variables of collection VARIABLES2 are used by the variables of collection VARIABLES1. For example, if VARIABLES1 is [1, 9, 1, 5, 2, 1] and VARIABLES2 is [1, 1, 2, 5], then all values in VARIABLES2 are used by VARIABLES1. The problem is to find values for the variables in VARIABLES1 and VARIABLES2 that satisfy these constraints.

 output

Expected Output:

    9,
    1,
    5
  ],
  "y": [

  ],
  "a": 3,
  "b": 4
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
