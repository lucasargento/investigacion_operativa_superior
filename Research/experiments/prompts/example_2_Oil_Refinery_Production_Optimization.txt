You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 2
- Name: Oil Refinery Production Optimization
- Domain: Industrial Engineering and Design
- Objective: maximization

Problem Description:
A manager of an oil refinery has several million barrels of crude oil of different types allocated for production during the coming month. These resources can be used to make multiple different products. Each product has a price it sells at. There are multiple production processes, each that uses some amount of each type of crude oil and produces some amount of each product. Each process has a cost per barrel of product produced. There is no separate cost for the crude oil as they have already been allocated. How many times should each process be executed to maximize the revenue for the next month? (we can assume that the number of times that each process is executed is a floating point number)


Input Data (data.dzn):
O = 2;
P = 2;
L = 3;
Allocated = [8000, 5000];
Price = [38, 33];
Input = array2d(1..3, 1..2, [3, 5, 1, 1, 5, 3]);
Output = array2d(1..3, 1..2, [4, 3, 1, 1, 3, 4]);
Cost = [51, 11, 40];


MiniZinc Model:
% Empty model file

Expected Output:
{
  "_objective": 339000.0
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
