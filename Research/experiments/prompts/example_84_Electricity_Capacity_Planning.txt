You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 84
- Name: Electricity Capacity Planning
- Domain: Energy and Natural Resources
- Objective: minimization

Problem Description:
A state wants to plan its electricity capacity for the next few years. It has a forecast of the demand for electricity per year for each of the following years. It knows the existing capacity per year, which is in oil-fired plants, that will not be retired. There are two alternatives for expanding electric capacity: coal-fired or nuclear power plants. There is a capital cost per unit of the coal-fired capacity that is incurred when a plant is established. Similarly, there is a capital cost per unit of nuclear power capacity that is incurred when a plant is established. Coal plants and nuclear plants will produce at their capacity until the end of their lifetime. Further, for various political and safety reasons, it has been decided that for each year, no more than a certain amount of the total capacity should ever be nuclear. 


Input Data (data.dzn):
T = 12;
Demand = [10, 15, 17, 20, 13, 19, 10, 25, 30, 33, 30, 35];
OilCap = [15, 14, 13, 10, 10, 7, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5];
CoalCost = 10;
NukeCost = 5;
MaxNuke = 20;
CoalLife = 5;
NukeLife = 10;


MiniZinc Model:
% Empty model file

Expected Output:
{
  "_objective": 353.0
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
