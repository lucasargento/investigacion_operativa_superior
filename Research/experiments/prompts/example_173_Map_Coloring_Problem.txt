You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 173
- Name: Map Coloring Problem
- Domain: Graph Theory
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
This problem is a map coloring problem. Given a number of countries and a matrix representing the connections between these countries, the task is to assign a color to each country such that no two adjacent countries have the same color. The colors are represented as integers from 1 to 4. The connections between countries are represented as a 2D matrix where a 1 indicates a connection and a 0 indicates no connection. The problem is to find a coloring that satisfies these constraints. The solution should be a list of colors assigned to each country in the order [belgium, denmark, france, germany, netherlands, luxembourg].


MiniZinc Model:
include "globals.mzn";


int: n; % number of countries
array[1..n] of var 1..4: country; % = [belgium, denmark, france, germany, netherlands, luxembourg];
array[1..n,1..n] of 0..1: connections; % the map (as a matrix)

% var int: ss = sum(i in 1..n) (i*country[i]); % bara en test

% The map (from an earlier version of the model)
%constraint
%	country_colour[france] 		!=	country_colour[belgium]
%  /\	country_colour[france] 		!= 	country_colour[luxembourg]
%  /\	country_colour[france] 		!= 	country_colour[germany]
%  /\	country_colour[luxembourg] 	!= 	country_colour[germany]
%  /\	country_colour[luxembourg] 	!= 	country_colour[belgium]
%  /\	country_colour[netherlands]	!= 	country_colour[belgium]
%  /\	country_colour[germany]		!= 	country_colour[belgium]
%  /\	country_colour[germany]		!= 	country_colour[netherlands]
%  /\	country_colour[germany] 	!= 	country_colour[denmark]
%;

%
%  coloring(connections, num_countries)
%    where
%      conn: an indicence matrix: 1 for connected, 0 for not connected
%                   (no self-loops)
%      contries: the array of the countries (country flag) to be solved
%      num_countries: the number of countries    
%
predicate coloring(array[int,int] of int: conn, array[int] of var int: countries, int: num_countries) =
           forall(i,j in 1..num_countries where i < j /\ conn[i,j] = 1) (
              countries[i] != countries[j]
           )
;

%
% Using the predicate
%
constraint 
    coloring(connections, country, n)

    % /\ % with the precedence symmetry breaking: 6 solutions
    % precedence(country)
;


solve satisfy;
% solve minimize sum(i in 1..n) (i*country[i]);

%
% data
%
n = 6; % number of countries

%
% The map as a matrix
%
% [belgium, denmark, france, germany, netherlands, luxembourg]
connections = 
array2d(1..n, 1..n, 
[    0,   0,   1,   1,   1,   1,
     0,   0,   0,   1,   0,   0,
     1,   0,   0,   1,   1,   0,
     1,   1,   1,   0,   1,   1,
     1,   0,   1,   1,   0,   0,
     1,   0,   0,   1,   0,   0
]);

output [
   "[belgium, denmark, france, germany, netherlands, luxembourg]\n",
   show(country), "\n" % ," : ", show(ss), "\n"
   
]
;

Expected Output:
{
  "country": [
    2,
    2,
    4,
    1,
    3,
    3
  ]
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.
