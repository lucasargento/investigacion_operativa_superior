You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 356
- Name: Pyramid Number Puzzle
- Domain: Puzzles
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
This problem involves a pyramid of numbers with 5 rows. Each brick of the pyramid is the sum of the two bricks situated below it. The pyramid is structured as follows:            [ 151]                                  [  ][  ]         [40][  ][  ]       [  ][  ][  ][  ]     [ X][11][ Y][ 4][ Z]Of the three missing numbers at the base of the pyramid, the middle one is the sum of the other two (that is, Y = X + Z). The goal is to find the values of X, Y, and Z that satisfy these conditions. The pyramid is represented in the code as an array of integers, where each element is the sum of the two elements below it in the pyramid. The pyramid is also represented as a 1D array, where the index of each element corresponds to its position in the pyramid. The problem is solved when the values of X, Y, and Z are found that satisfy the conditions of the pyramid.


MiniZinc Model:

int: len = (n*(n + 1)) div 2; % number of entries

% the triangle numbers for 1..n
array[1..n] of 1..len: t = [i*(i+1) div 2 | i in 1..n] ;

% the index of first number to use in the addition
array[1..t[n-1]] of var 1..len: adds;

% decision variables, the pyramid
array[1..len] of var int: x;

var int: X;
var int: Y;
var int: Z;

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
