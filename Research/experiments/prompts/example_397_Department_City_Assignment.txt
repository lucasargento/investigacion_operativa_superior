You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 397
- Name: Department City Assignment
- Domain: Operations Research
- Objective: maximization

Problem Description:
This problem is about decentralization and is taken from H. Paul Williams' 'Model Building in Mathematical Programming'. The problem involves 5 departments that need to be located in 3 cities: Bristol, Brighton, and London. Each department has a certain benefit associated with each city, and there are communication costs between each pair of cities. The goal is to maximize the total cost, which is the sum of the benefits of each department in each city minus the communication costs between each pair of departments in each pair of cities. The constraints are that each department must be located in one city, and there can be at most 3 departments in each city. The decision variables are binary and indicate whether a department is in a city and whether a pair of departments are in a pair of cities.


MiniZinc Model:
set of int: ndepts = 1..5;  % departments
set of int: ncities = 1..3; %  cities, Bristol, Brighton, london
set of int: ncitiesm1 = 1..2; % cities, Bristol, Brighton

% benefits (£k)
array[ndepts,ncities] of int: benefit = array2d(ndepts, ncities, 
              [10,10,0,
               15,20,0, 
               10,15,0,
               20,15,0,
               5,15,0]); 

%  communication costs/unit(£)
array[ncities,ncities] of int: dist = array2d(ncities, ncities, [5,14,13,14,5,9,13,9,10]);

% quantities of communication (k units)
array[ndepts,ndepts] of float: comm = array2d(ndepts, ndepts, 
        [0.0,0.0,1.0,1.5,0.0,

                  sum(i in ndepts, j in ncities, k in ndepts, l in ncities where k> i) (
                  comm[i,k]*int2float(dist[j,l])*int2float(g[i,j,k,l])
              );

% solve maximize tcost;

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
