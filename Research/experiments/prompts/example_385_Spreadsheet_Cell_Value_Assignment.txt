You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 385
- Name: Spreadsheet Cell Value Assignment
- Domain: Spreadsheets
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
This problem is a representation of a spreadsheet in MiniZinc. The spreadsheet contains several cells, each represented by a variable: B1, B4, B5, C4, C5, D4, D5, E7, E8. Each of these variables can take a value between 0.0 and 1000.0. The problem is to find values for these variables that satisfy the following constraints: B1 = 0.17, B4 = 3.5, B5 = 1.7, C4 = 1.5, C5 = 4.5, D4 = B4 * C4, D5 = B5 * C5, E7 = D4 + D5, and E8 = E7 * (1.0 + B1).


MiniZinc Model:
var 0.0..1000.0: B1;
var 0.0..1000.0: B4;
var 0.0..1000.0: B5;
var 0.0..1000.0: C4;
var 0.0..1000.0: C5;
var 0.0..1000.0: D4;
var 0.0..1000.0: D5;
var 0.0..1000.0: E7;
var 0.0..1000.0: E8;

solve satisfy;

constraint
      B1 = 0.17 /\
      B4 = 3.5 /\
      B5 = 1.7 /\
      C4 = 1.5 /\
      C5 = 4.5 /\
      D4 = B4 * C4 /\
      D5 = B5 * C5 /\
      E7 = D4 + D5 /\
      E8 = E7 * (1.0 + B1) 
;


output [
  show([B1, B4, B5,C4,C5,D4,D5,E7,E8]) 

];

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
