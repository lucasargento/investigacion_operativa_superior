You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 506
- Name: Minimum Set Representation
- Domain: Set Theory
- Objective: minimization

Problem Description:
The problem is to choose the minimum number of people which represents a complete given set. Each line of the input set represents one group, and the number represents the ID of the member in the group. Only one member should be chosen from each group. 2-tuple members will not be repeated, but members can be part of more than one group. For example, given the input set:

1009 2000
1009 2001
1002 2002
1003 2002

The answer would be 1009 and 2002, which represents the sets. 1009 is chosen because it is representing two teams and the same is the case for 2002. Another example would be:

1009 2000
1009 2001
1002 2002
1003 2002
1004 2003

The answer can be { 1009 , 2002, 1004} or { 1009, 2002, 2003}. The goal is to find an algorithm that can solve this problem.


MiniZinc Model:
include "globals.mzn"; 

% int: n = 4; 
% array[1..n, 1..2] of int: input = array2d(1..n, 1..2, [1009, 2000,
%                                                        1009, 2001,
%                                                        1002, 2002,
%                                                        1003, 2002]);

int: n = 5;
array[1..n, 1..2] of int: input = array2d(1..n, 1..2, [1009, 2000,
                                                       1009, 2001,
                                                       1002, 2002,
                                                       1003, 2002,
                                                       1004, 2003]);

% example from a comment (n.m.)
% (unsolvable)
% int: n = 3;
% array[1..n, 1..2] of int: input = array2d(1..n,  1..2, [1,2,
%                                                         2,3,
%                                                         3,1
%                                                         ]);

% the ids (for the domains in s)
set of int: ids = { input[i,j] | i in 1..n, j in 1..2};

% decision variables
var set of ids: s;



% solve satisfy;
solve minimize(card(s));
% solve :: int_search(x, first_fail, indomain_min, complete) satisfy;

% Testing first example (unique solution)
% constraint card(s) = 2;

% Testing second example (2 solutions)
% constraint card(s) = 3;

constraint
   forall(i in 1..n) (
      % "Only one member should be choose from each Group"
      % -> xor
      input[i,1] in s xor input[i,2] in s
   )
;

output [
  "ids: " ++ show(ids) ++ "\n" ++
  "s  : " ++ show(s) ++ "\n" ++ 
  "card(s): " ++ show(card(s)) ++ "\n"
]
 ++ ["\n"]
;

Expected Output:
{
  "s": {
    "set": [
      1004,
      1009,
      2002
    ]
  },
  "_objective": 3
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
