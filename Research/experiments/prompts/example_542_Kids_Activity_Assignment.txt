You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 542
- Name: Kids Activity Assignment
- Domain: Scheduling
- Objective: maximization

Problem Description:
The problem is about assigning a group of kids to some activities. Each kid fills a form where they specify 3 choices of activities in order of preference. Each activity has a maximum number of participants. The goal is to find a solution where the choices are respected as much as possible without exceeding the maximum number of participants for each activity. The link between the number of choice, activity, and children is known. The problem is to define relevant constraints so that all permutations are considered, a score is given to each (adding the numbers of choices to get the minimum), and results with too big groups are eliminated. The problem is to find a good way to do this using constraint programming.


MiniZinc Model:
include "globals.mzn"; 

int: num_kids;
array[1..num_kids, 1..3] of int: prefs;

int: num_activities;
array[1..num_activities] of int: activity_size;

% decision variables
array[1..num_kids] of var 1..num_activities: x; % the selected activity
array[1..num_kids] of var 1..num_activities: scores;

var int: total_score = sum(scores);

solve maximize total_score;
% solve satisfy;
% solve :: int_search(x ++ scores, first_fail, indomain_split, complete) maximize total_score;

constraint
  forall(k in 1..num_kids) (
    % select one of the prefered activities

    % exists(p in 1..3) (
    %   x[k] = prefs[k,p] /\
    %   scores[k] = 4-p % score for the selected activity
    % )
    % alternative:
    let {
      var 1..3: p
    } in 
      x[k] = prefs[k,p] /\
      scores[k] = 4-p % score for the selected activity
  )

  /\ % ensure size of the activities
  % 
  % forall(a in 1..num_activities) (
  %  sum([bool2int(x[k] = a) | k in 1..num_kids]) <= activity_size[a]
  % )

  global_cardinality_low_up(x, [i | i in 1..num_activities], [0 | i in 1..num_activities], activity_size)

  % /\ total_score = 17 % for solve satisfy and the second activity_size

;

output [
  "x     : ", show(x), "\n",
  "scores: ", show(scores), "\n",
  "total_score: ", show(total_score), "\n",

];

%
% some small fake data
%
num_kids = 6;
num_activities = 4;

% Activity preferences for each kid
prefs = array2d(1..num_kids, 1..3,
[
  1,2,3,
  4,2,1,
  2,1,4,
  4,2,1,
  3,2,4,
  4,1,3
]);

% max size of activity
activity_size = [2,2,2,3];
% activity_size = [2,2,2,2];

Expected Output:
{
  "x": [
    1,
    4,
    2,
    4,
    3,
    4
  ],
  "scores": [
    3,
    3,
    3,
    3,
    3,
    3
  ],
  "_objective": 18
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.
