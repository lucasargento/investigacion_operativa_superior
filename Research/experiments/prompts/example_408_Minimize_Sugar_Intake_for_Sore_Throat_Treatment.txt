You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 408
- Name: Minimize Sugar Intake for Sore Throat Treatment
- Domain: Healthcare
- Objective: minimization

Problem Description:
A patient with a sore throat can drink two syrups , syrup 1 and syrup 2 for treatment . Per serving , syrup 1 delivers 0.5 units of medicine to the throat and 0.4 units of medicine to the lungs . Per serving , syrup 2 delivers 0.2 units of medicine to the throat and 0.5 units of medicine to the lungs . Furthermore , syrup 1 contains 0.5 units of sugar while syrup 2 contains 0.3 units of sugar per serving . The patient can get at most 5 units of medicine for the throat and at least 4 units of medicine to the lungs . How many servings of each should the patient take to minimize his sugar intake ?


MiniZinc Model:
var int: syrup1;
%units of syrup2
var int: syrup2;

% servings are non-negative
constraint syrup1 >= 0;
constraint syrup2 >= 0;

% medicine delivered to the throat is at most 5 units
% syrup 1 delivers 0.5 units of medicine to the throat and syrup 2 delivers 0.2 units 
constraint syrup1 * 0.5 + syrup2 * 0.2 <= 5;
% medicine delivered to the lungs is at least 4 units
% syrup 1 delivers 0.4 units of medicine to the lungs and syrup 2 delivers 0.5 units
constraint syrup1 * 0.4 + syrup2 * 0.5 >= 4;

% syrup 1 contains 0.5 units of sugar while syrup 2 contains 0.3 units of sugar per serving
var float: sugar = syrup1 * 0.5 + syrup2 * 0.3;

% minimize sugar
solve minimize sugar;

output ["Syrup 1: " ++ show(syrup1) ++ "\nSyrup 2: " ++ show(syrup2)];

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
