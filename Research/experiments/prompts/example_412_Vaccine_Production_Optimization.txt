You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 412
- Name: Vaccine Production Optimization
- Domain: Healthcare
- Objective: minimization

Problem Description:
A lab has 20000 mg of mRNA anti - viral available to make children 's and adult vaccines . Each children 's vaccine contains 50 mg of mRNA and 50 mg of fever suppressant . Each adult vaccine contains 75 mg of mRNA and 75 mg of fever suppressant . Since adult vaccines are more essential , at least 70 % of vaccines should be adult vaccines . However , at least 50 children 's vaccines should be made . How many of each vaccine should be made to minimize the amount of fever suppressant used ?


MiniZinc Model:
var int: children_vaccines; 
% number of adult vaccines
var int: adult_vaccines; 

% vaccines produced are non-negative
constraint children_vaccines >= 0;
constraint adult_vaccines >= 0;

% 20000 mg of mRNA anti-viral is available
% children's vaccines contains 50mg of mRNA and adult vaccine contains 75mg of mRNA
constraint children_vaccines * 50 + adult_vaccines * 75 <= 20000; 
% at least 70% of vaccines should be adult vacines
constraint adult_vaccines >= 0.7 * (children_vaccines + adult_vaccines); 
% at least 50 children's vaccines should be made
constraint children_vaccines >= 50;

% each children 's vaccine contains 50 mg of fever suppressant and each adult vaccine contains 75 mg of fever suppressant
var int: total_fever_suppressant = children_vaccines * 50 + adult_vaccines * 75;

% minimize the amount of fever suppressant used
solve minimize total_fever_suppressant;

% output
output ["Children's Vaccines: " ++ show(children_vaccines) ++ "\nAdult Vaccines: " ++ show(adult_vaccines)];

Expected Output:
{
  "children_vaccines": 50,
  "adult_vaccines": 117,
  "_objective": 11275
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
