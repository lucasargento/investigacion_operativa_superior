You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 526
- Name: Digit Arrangement for Equal Products
- Domain: Mathematics
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
The problem is to arrange the digits 1 to 9 in two multiplications which give the same product. The digits are arranged as follows: ABC * DE = FG * HI = s, where A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I are distinct digits from 1 to 9, and s is the product. The goal is to find the arrangement of digits that satisfies this equation. The problem has 11 solutions, and the maximum product is 7448.


MiniZinc Model:
include "globals.mzn"; 

set of 1..9: d = 1..9;
var d: A;
var d: B;
var d: C;
var d: D;
var d: E;
var d: F;
var d: G;
var d: H;
var d: I;

var int: s; % the sum

array[d] of var d: x = [A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I];


% solve satisfy;
solve :: int_search(x, first_fail, indomain_min, complete) satisfy;
% solve :: int_search(x, first_fail, indomain_min, complete) maximize s;

constraint

   all_different(x)

   /\
   s = (100*A + 10*B + C) * (10*D + E) 
   /\
   s = (10*F + G) * (10*H + I) 
   /\
   (10*F + G) <= (10*H + I)  % symmetry breaking
   /\
   s = 7448
;


output [
  "Solution:\n",
  "  ", show(A), show(B), show(C), "\n",
  "*  ", show(D), show(E), "\n",
  "-----\n",
  " ", show(s), "\n",
  "\n", 
  "   ", show(F), show(G), "\n",
  " * ", show(H), show(I), "\n",
  "-----\n",
  " ", show(s),"\n",

];

Expected Output:
{
  "A": 5,
  "B": 3,
  "C": 2,
  "D": 1,
  "E": 4,
  "F": 7,
  "G": 6,
  "H": 9,
  "I": 8,
  "s": 7448
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
