You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 459
- Name: Position of Ith Non-Zero Item
- Domain: Sequences
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
The problem is about finding the position of the ith non-zero item in a sequence of variables. Given a sequence of variables, the position (POS) is the position of the ITHth non-zero item of the sequence. For example, given the sequence [3,0,0,8,6], the position of the 2nd non-zero item is 4. The problem is to verify this constraint for a given sequence, position and ith value.


MiniZinc Model:
int: n = 5;
array[1..n] of var 0..8: x;
var 1..n: ith;
var 1..n: pos;

predicate ith_pos_different_from_0(var int: ith, 
                                   var int: pos, 
                                   array[int] of var int: x) =
   let {
        int: lbx = min(index_set(x)),
        int: ubx = max(index_set(x))
   } in
   exists(i in lbx..ubx) (
     pos = i 
     /\
     ith = sum(j in lbx..i) (bool2int(x[j] != 0))
     /\
     x[i] != 0
   )
;

predicate cp1d(array[int] of var int: x, array[int] of var int: y) =
  assert(index_set(x) = index_set(y),
           "cp1d: x and y have different sizes",
     forall(i in index_set(x)) ( x[i] = y[i] ))
; 

solve satisfy;

constraint
   cp1d(x,[3,0,0,8,6])
   /\
   pos = 4
   /\
   ith = 2
   /\
   ith_pos_different_from_0(ith, pos, x)
;

output
[
  "x: " ++ show(x) ++ "\n" ++
  "pos: " ++ show(pos) ++ "\n" ++
  "ith: " ++ show(ith) ++ "\n"
 
];

Expected Output:
{
  "x": [
    3,
    0,
    0,
    8,
    6
  ],
  "ith": 2,
  "pos": 4
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
