You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 394
- Name: Markov Chain Stable State
- Domain: Statistics
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
The problem is about Markov Chains and it is taken from the Swedish book 'Statistisk Dataanalys', page 299ff. The problem involves a transition matrix of market shares for three products A, B, and C. The transition matrix is as follows: 

From   To
A    B     C
A   0.7  0.1   0.2
B   0.2  0.6   0.2
C   0.4  0.1   0.5

The task is to find the stable state of the transitions. The stable state is a state that remains unchanged in the Markov Chain after a certain number of transitions. The problem also tests the reverse problem of generating a transition matrix given the stable state. The decision variables are represented by an array 'x' and the transition matrix is represented by a 2D array 'transitions'. The constraints ensure that the sum of the products of the transition probabilities and the corresponding state probabilities is equal to the state probability for each state, and the sum of all state probabilities is 1. The problem is solved when these constraints are satisfied.


MiniZinc Model:
int: n;
array[1..n] of var 0.0..1.0: x;             % the decision variables
array[1..n, 1..n] of var 0.0..1.0: transitions; % the transition matrix

% solve :: float_search([transitions[i,j] | i,j in 1..n], 0.001, "input_order", "indomain_split", "complete") satisfy;
solve satisfy;
% for the reverse mode:
% solve maximize sum(j in 1..n) (transitions[1,j]);

constraint
  % the "talkative" version
  % 0.7*A + 0.2*B + 0.4*C = A
  % /\
  % 0.1*A + 0.6*B + 0.1*C = B
  % /\
  % 0.2*A + 0.2*B + 0.5*C = C
  % /\ A+B+C = 1.0

  % general solution
  forall(i in 1..n) (
    x[i] = sum(j in 1..n) (transitions[i,j]*x[j])
  )
  /\
  sum(i in 1..n) (x[i]) = 1.0 

  % /\ % For the reversed problem, i.e. generate the transition matrix given
     %% the stable state.

     % x = [0.3,0.15,0.1,0.15,0.3]
     %% for n = 10
     % x = [0.6,0.2,0.1, 0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0, 0.1]

4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.
