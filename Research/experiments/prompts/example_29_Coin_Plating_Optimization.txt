You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 29
- Name: Coin Plating Optimization
- Domain: Mathematical Modeling
- Objective: maximization

Problem Description:
A coin plating operation involves two processes: process A and process B. Process A uses a fixed amount of gold and wires to plate a certain number of coins, while process B uses different amounts of gold and wires to plate a different number of coins. With limited resources of gold and wires, the objective is to determine how many times each process should be executed to maximize the total number of coins plated.


Input Data (data.dzn):
GoldPerA = 3;
WiresPerA = 2;
CoinsPerA = 5;
GoldPerB = 5;
WiresPerB = 3;
CoinsPerB = 7;
TotalGold = 500;
TotalWires = 300;

% PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
% -------------------
% A factory plates coins using two processes: Process A and Process B.
% - Process A consumes a fixed amount of gold and wires to plate a set number of coins.
% - Process B uses a different amount of gold and wires to plate a different number of coins.
% - The factory has a limited supply of gold and wires.
%
% OBJECTIVE:
% ----------
% Determine how many times each process should be run to **maximize**
% the total number of plated coins while staying within the resource constraints.

%   "GoldPerA": <int>, "WiresPerA": <int>, "CoinsPerA": <int>,
%   "GoldPerB": <int>, "WiresPerB": <int>, "CoinsPerB": <int>,
%   "TotalGold": <int>, "TotalWires": <int>
% }
% ============================================================


% -----------------------------
% 1) PARAMETERS
% -----------------------------

int: GoldPerA;      % Gold required per run of Process A
int: WiresPerA;     % Wires required per run of Process A
int: CoinsPerA;     % Coins plated per run of Process A

int: GoldPerB;      % Gold required per run of Process B
int: WiresPerB;     % Wires required per run of Process B
int: CoinsPerB;     % Coins plated per run of Process B

int: TotalGold;     % Total available gold units
int: TotalWires;    % Total available wire units


% -----------------------------
% 2) DECISION VARIABLES
% -----------------------------

% The number of times Process A and Process B will be run
var 0..TotalGold div GoldPerA: ProcessA;
var 0..TotalGold div GoldPerB: ProcessB;

% The total number of coins plated
var int: TotalCoins;


% -----------------------------
% 3) CONSTRAINTS
% -----------------------------

% (C1) Gold Constraint: The total gold used cannot exceed the available supply.
constraint
    ProcessA * GoldPerA + ProcessB * GoldPerB <= TotalGold;

% (C2) Wire Constraint: The total wires used cannot exceed the available supply.
constraint
    ProcessA * WiresPerA + ProcessB * WiresPerB <= TotalWires;

% (C3) Total Coins Calculation
% The total coins plated is the sum of coins plated from both processes.
constraint
    TotalCoins = ProcessA * CoinsPerA + ProcessB * CoinsPerB;


% -----------------------------
% 4) OBJECTIVE FUNCTION
% -----------------------------

% Maximize the total number of plated coins.
solve maximize TotalCoins;


% -----------------------------
% 5) OUTPUT
% -----------------------------

% Print the number of times each process runs and the total plated coins.
output [
    "Optimal Process Execution:\n",
    "  Process A Runs: ", show(ProcessA), "\n",
    "  Process B Runs: ", show(ProcessB), "\n",
    "Maximum Coins Plated: ", show(TotalCoins), "\n"
];

Expected Output:

  "ProcessA": 150,
  "ProcessB": 0,
  "TotalCoins": 750,
  "_objective": 750
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.
