You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 469
- Name: Roots Constraint Satisfaction
- Domain: Constraint Satisfaction
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
The problem is defined by a global constraint called 'roots'. The constraint is defined as follows: Given a set S, a set T, and a collection of variables, S is the set of indices of the variables in the collection taking their values in T; S = {i | VARIABLES[i].var in T}. For example, given the sets S = {2, 4, 5}, T = {2, 3, 8}, and the collection of variables <1, 3, 1, 2, 3>, the roots constraint holds since values 2 and 3 in T occur in the collection <1, 3, 1, 2, 3> only at positions S={2, 4, 5}. The value 8 in T does not occur within the collection <1, 3, 1, 2, 3>. The problem is to find the values of the variables in the collection that satisfy this constraint.


MiniZinc Model:
include "globals.mzn"; 

int: n = 5;
array[1..n] of var 1..3: x;
var set of 1..5: s;
var set of 1..8: t;

predicate cp1d(array[int] of var int: x, array[int] of var int: y) =
  assert(index_set(x) = index_set(y),
           "cp1d: x and y have different sizes",
     forall(i in index_set(x)) ( x[i] = y[i] ))
; 

solve satisfy;

constraint
  cp1d(x, [1,3,1,2,3])
  /\
  s = {2,4,5}
  /\
  t = {2,3,8}
  /\
  roots(x, s, t)
;


output [
"x: " ++ show(x) ++ "\n"++
"s: " ++ show(s) ++ "\n"++
"t: " ++ show(t) ++ "\n"
];

Expected Output:
{
  "x": [
    1,
    3,
    1,
    2,
    3
  ],
  "s": {
    "set": [
      2,
      [
        4,
        5
      ]
    ]
  },
  "t": {
    "set": [
      [
        2,
        3
      ],
      8
    ]
  }
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
