You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 28
- Name: Hand Sanitizer Production Optimization
- Domain: Mathematical Modeling
- Objective: maximization

Problem Description:
A company produces liquid and foam hand sanitizers using limited water and alcohol resources. Each type of sanitizer requires a different amount of ingredients and cleans a different number of hands. The company must ensure that more foam sanitizers are produced than liquid sanitizers, while also limiting the number of liquid sanitizers produced. The objective is to maximize the number of hands that can be cleaned.


Input Data (data.dzn):
WaterPerLiquid = 40;
AlcoholPerLiquid = 50;
WaterPerFoam = 60;
AlcoholPerFoam = 40;

TotalWater = 2000;
TotalAlcohol = 2100;

HandsPerLiquid = 30;
HandsPerFoam = 20;

MaxLiquid = 30;

% PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
% -------------------
% A company manufactures liquid and foam hand sanitizers, both of which require
% water and alcohol as key ingredients. Each sanitizer type can clean a certain
% number of hands, and there are constraints on production.
%
% - Each sanitizer requires a fixed amount of water and alcohol.
% - The total available water and alcohol limit production.
% - More foam sanitizers must be produced than liquid sanitizers.
% - Liquid sanitizers have a production cap.
%
% OBJECTIVE:
% ----------
% Find the optimal number of liquid and foam sanitizers to produce to **maximize**
% the total number of hands that can be cleaned while staying within the resource limits.
%
% PARAMETERS PROVIDED IN JSON:
% {
%   "TotalWater": <int>, "TotalAlcohol": <int>,
%   "WaterPerLiquid": <int>, "AlcoholPerLiquid": <int>,
%   "WaterPerFoam": <int>, "AlcoholPerFoam": <int>,
%   "HandsPerLiquid": <int>, "HandsPerFoam": <int>,
%   "MaxLiquid": <int>
% }
% ============================================================


% -----------------------------
% 1) PARAMETERS
% -----------------------------

int: TotalWater;      % Total available water
int: TotalAlcohol;    % Total available alcohol

int: WaterPerLiquid;  % Water required per liquid sanitizer
int: AlcoholPerLiquid;% Alcohol required per liquid sanitizer
int: WaterPerFoam;    % Water required per foam sanitizer
int: AlcoholPerFoam;  % Alcohol required per foam sanitizer

int: HandsPerLiquid;  % Cleaning capacity per liquid sanitizer
int: HandsPerFoam;    % Cleaning capacity per foam sanitizer

int: MaxLiquid;       % Maximum number of liquid sanitizers


% -----------------------------
% 2) DECISION VARIABLES
% -----------------------------

% The number of liquid and foam sanitizers to produce
var 0..MaxLiquid: LiquidSanitizers;
var 0..TotalWater div WaterPerFoam: FoamSanitizers;

% The total number of hands that can be cleaned
var int: TotalHandsCleaned;


% -----------------------------
% 3) CONSTRAINTS
% -----------------------------

% (C1) Water Constraint: The total water used cannot exceed available supply.
constraint
    LiquidSanitizers * WaterPerLiquid + FoamSanitizers * WaterPerFoam <= TotalWater;

% (C2) Alcohol Constraint: The total alcohol used cannot exceed available supply.
constraint
    LiquidSanitizers * AlcoholPerLiquid + FoamSanitizers * AlcoholPerFoam <= TotalAlcohol;

% (C3) Production Constraint: More foam sanitizers must be produced than liquid sanitizers.
constraint
    FoamSanitizers > LiquidSanitizers;

% (C4) Total Hands Calculation:
% The total number of hands cleaned is the sum from both types of sanitizers.
constraint
    TotalHandsCleaned = LiquidSanitizers * HandsPerLiquid + FoamSanitizers * HandsPerFoam;


% -----------------------------
% 4) OBJECTIVE FUNCTION
% -----------------------------

% Maximize the total number of hands cleaned.
solve maximize TotalHandsCleaned;


% -----------------------------
% 5) OUTPUT
% -----------------------------

% Print the number of each sanitizer produced and the total hands cleaned.
output [
    "Optimal Sanitizer Production Plan:\n",
    "  Liquid Sanitizers Produced: ", show(LiquidSanitizers), "\n",
    "  Foam Sanitizers Produced: ", show(FoamSanitizers), "\n",
    "Maximum Hands Cleaned: ", show(TotalHandsCleaned), "\n"
];

Expected Output:
{
  "LiquidSanitizers": 19,
  "FoamSanitizers": 20,
  "TotalHandsCleaned": 970,
  "_objective": 970
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.
