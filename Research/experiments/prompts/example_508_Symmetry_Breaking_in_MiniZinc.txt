You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 508
- Name: Symmetry Breaking in MiniZinc
- Domain: Mathematics
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
The problem is about symmetry breaking in MiniZinc. The task is to find seven integers A, B, C, D, E, F, G in the range of 1 to 50 that satisfy the following conditions: The sum of the cubes of A, B, C, and D is equal to the sum of the cubes of E, F, and G. Additionally, the integers must satisfy the following symmetry conditions: A is less than or equal to B, B is less than or equal to C, C is less than or equal to D, E is less than or equal to F, F is less than or equal to G, and A is less than or equal to E.


MiniZinc Model:
var 1..50: A;
var 1..50: B;
var 1..50: C;
var 1..50: D;
var 1..50: E;
var 1..50: F;
var 1..50: G;

solve satisfy;

constraint
   A*A*A + B*B*B + C*C*C + D*D*D = E*E*E + F*F*F + G*G*G /\

   % symmetries in left side
   A <= B /\
   B <= C /\
   C <= D /\

   % symmetries in right side
   E <= F /\
   F <= G /\
 
   % and between the sides
   A <= E
;

output [
  show(A), "^3 + ",
  show(B), "^3 +",
  show(C), "^3 + ",
  show(D), "^3 = ",
  show(E), "^3 + ",
  show(F), "^3 + ",
  show(G), "^3 ","\n"
];

Expected Output:
{
  "A": 1,
  "B": 4,
  "C": 4,
  "D": 6,
  "E": 1,
  "F": 1,
  "G": 7
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.
