You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 272
- Name: Domino Problem
- Domain: Academic
- Objective: minimization

Problem Description:
# Problem Domino

This problem is described in the paper cited below.
Informally the Domino problem is an undirected constraint graph with a cycle and a trigger constraint.

## Data
  a pair (n,d), where n is the number of variables and d the size of the domain

## Model
  There are two variants: a main one and a variant 'table' with constraints in extension.

  constraints: [AllEqual](http://pycsp.org/documentation/constraints/AllEqual), [Table](http://pycsp.org/documentation/constraints/Table)

## Execution
```
  python Domino.py
  python Domino.py -data=[number,number]
  python Domino.py -data=[number,number] -variant=table
```

MiniZinc Model:
include "globals.mzn";

% Define the number of variables and the size of the domain
int: n = 5;
int: d = 3;

% Define the variant type
string: variant = "primary";

% Define the variables
array[1..n] of var 1..d: vars;

% Define the constraints
constraint if variant = "primary" then alldifferent(vars) else forall(i in 1..n-1)(vars[i] = vars[i+1]) endif;

% Define the objective function
var int: obj = sum(vars);

% Solve the problem
solve minimize obj;

% Output the solution
output ["Variables: " ++ show(vars) ++ "\nObjective: " ++ show(obj)];

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
