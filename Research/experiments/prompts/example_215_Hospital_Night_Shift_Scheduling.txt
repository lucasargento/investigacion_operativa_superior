You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 215
- Name: Hospital Night Shift Scheduling
- Domain: Healthcare
- Objective: minimization

Problem Description:
The goal is to find the minimal number of nurses the hospital needs to hire for a planning period of Period. The hospital has a known demand for nurses across a week, specified by the array Demand, where each element corresponds to the demand for a particular day in the period.


Input Data (data.dzn):
Period = 4;
Demand = [0, 5, 9, 15, 4, 7, 3];

MiniZinc Model:
% Parameters
int: T; % Number of days in a week
int: Period; % Number of days a nurse works in a row
array[1..T] of int: Demand; % Demand for nurses for each day

% Decision Variables
array[1..T] of var 0..sum(Demand): start; % Number of nurses that start their period on each day
var 0..sum(Demand): total; % Total number of nurses hired

% Constraints
constraint total = sum(start); % Total number of nurses is the sum of all starting nurses

% For each day, the number of working nurses should meet the demand
constraint forall(j in 1..T) (
    sum(i in max(1, j - Period + 1)..j) (start[(i-1) mod T + 1]) >= Demand[j]
);

% Objective
solve minimize total;

% Output
output ["start: ", show(start), "\n", "total: ", show(total)];

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
