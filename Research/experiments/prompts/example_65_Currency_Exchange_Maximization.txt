You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 65
- Name: Currency Exchange Maximization
- Domain: Finance and Investment
- Objective: maximization

Problem Description:
Suppose that there is a given a number of available currencies, and assume that we have the exchange rate between each currency. Also certain regulations impose a limit on the total amount of each currency that can be exchanged (whether to other currencies or from other currencies) on any given day. Suppose that we start the day with a given number of units of each currency.

Assume that for any sequence i_1, â€¦ ,i_k of currencies, we have rate_{i_1,i_2}, rate_{i_2,i_3}, ..., rate_{i_{k-1}, i_{k}}, rate_{i_k, i_1} <= 1, which means that wealth cannot be multiplied by going through a cycle of currencies. Maximize the number of units of currency that we end up with at the end of the day, through a sequence of currency transactions.


Input Data (data.dzn):
N = 3;
Start = [100.0, 50.0, 200.0];
Limit = [1000.0, 200.0, 3000.0];
Rate = array2d(1..3, 1..3, [0.99, 0.9, 1.02, 0.95, 0.99, 0.92, 0.9, 0.91, 0.99]);


MiniZinc Model:
% Empty model file

Expected Output:
{
  "_objective": 350.45
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
