You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 415
- Name: Pharmacy Production Optimization
- Domain: Manufacturing
- Objective: minimization

Problem Description:
A pharmacy has two factories , factory 1 and factory 2 , where they make acne cream and anti - bacterial cream . Factory 1 produces 12 units of acne cream and 15 units of anti - bacterial cream per hour . Factory 2 produces 20 units of acne cream and 10 units of anti - bacterial cream per hour . Factory 1 requires 30 units of base gel per hour while factory 2 requires 45 units of base gel per hour . The pharmacy has available 5000 units of base gel . Further , they must make at least 800 units of acne cream and 1000 units of anti - bacterial cream . How many hours should each factory be run to minimize the total time needed ?


MiniZinc Model:
var int: hours_factory1;
% number of hours facroty 2 is run
var int: hours_factory2;

% number of hours must be non-negative
constraint hours_factory1 >= 0;
constraint hours_factory2 >= 0;

% The pharmacy has available 5000 units of base gel. 
% factory 1 requires 30 units of base gel per hour while factory 2 requires 45 units of base gel per hour
constraint hours_factory1 * 30 + hours_factory2 * 45 <= 5000;

% they must make at least 800 units of acne cream a
% factory 1 produces 12 units of acne cream and Factory 2 produces 20 units of acne cream
constraint hours_factory1 * 12 + hours_factory2 * 20 >= 800;

% they must make at least 1000 units of anti - bacterial cream 
% factory 1 produces 15 units of anti-bacterial cream per hour and factory 2 produces 10 units of anti-bacterial cream per hour
constraint hours_factory1 * 15 + hours_factory2 * 10 >= 1000;

% minimize the total time needed 
solve minimize hours_factory1 + hours_factory2;

% output
output ["Hours for Factory 1: " ++ show(hours_factory1) ++ "\nHours for Factory 2: " ++ show(hours_factory2)];

Expected Output:
{
  "hours_factory1": 67,
  "hours_factory2": 0,
  "_objective": 67
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
