You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 235
- Name: Quadratic Curve Fitting
- Domain: Statistics
- Objective: minimization

Problem Description:
Fit the ‘best’ quadratic curve y = c * x^2 + b * x + a to this set of data points. The objective is to minimize the sum of absolute deviations of each observed value of ObservedValues from the value predicted by the quadratic relationship with ObservedXValues.


Input Data (data.dzn):
y = array1d(1..19, [1.0, 0.9, 0.7, 1.5, 2.0, 2.4, 3.2, 2.0, 2.7, 3.5, 1.0, 4.0, 3.6, 2.7, 5.7, 4.6, 6.0, 6.8, 7.3]);
x = array1d(1..19, [0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 1.9, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.6, 7.0, 7.6, 8.5, 9.0, 10.0]);

MiniZinc Model:
% Load data from .dzn file
include "globals.mzn";

% Define parameters
array[1..19] of float: y;
array[1..19] of float: x;

% Define decision variables
var float: quadratic;
var float: linear;
var float: constant;
array[1..19] of var float: deviations;

% Define constraints
constraint forall(i in 1..19) (
    deviations[i] = abs(y[i] - (quadratic * (x[i]^2) + linear * x[i] + constant))
);

% Define objective function
var float: total_deviation = sum(deviations);
solve minimize total_deviation;

% Output solution
output ["quadratic: ", show(quadratic), "\n",
        "linear: ", show(linear), "\n",
        "constant: ", show(constant), "\n"];

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
