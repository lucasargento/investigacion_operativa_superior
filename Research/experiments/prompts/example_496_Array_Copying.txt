You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 496
- Name: Array Copying
- Domain: Array Operations
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
The problem is about copying arrays in MiniZinc 2. The model includes several functions and predicates to copy 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional arrays of integers and sets of integers. The copying functions ensure that the source and destination arrays have the same size and that the elements of the source array are copied to the corresponding positions in the destination array. The model also includes a constraint section where these functions are used to copy specific arrays. The goal of the model is to find a solution that satisfies all the constraints.

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.
