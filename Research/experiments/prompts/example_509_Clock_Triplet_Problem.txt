You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 509
- Name: Clock Triplet Problem
- Domain: Puzzles
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
The Clock Triplet Problem, originally posed by Dean Clark and presented by Martin Gardner, involves the twelve numbers on the face of a clock. The task is to rearrange the numbers (keeping them in a circle) so no triplet of adjacent numbers has a sum higher than 21. This is the smallest value that the highest sum of a triplet can have. The problem is to find such an arrangement of numbers. The numbers are represented as an array of variables 'x' where each element can take a value from 1 to 12. The sum of the triplets is represented by the variable 'triplet_sum'. The constraints ensure that all numbers are different, the sum of any triplet of adjacent numbers is less than or equal to 'triplet_sum', and the number 12 is at the 0th position of the array. The problem is to find a satisfying assignment for the variables that meets all the constraints.


MiniZinc Model:
include "globals.mzn"; 

array[0..11] of var 1..12: x;
var 0..100: triplet_sum; % the sum of the triplets


% solve minimize triplet_sum; % checks if 21 really is the highest value
solve satisfy;


constraint
    triplet_sum <= 21
    /\
    all_different(x)
    /\
    x[0] = 12 /\      
    x[1] > x[11] /\   
    forall(i in 2..11) (
      x[i] + x[i-1] + x[i-2] <= triplet_sum
    )
    /\ % and around the corners
    x[10] + x[11] + x[0]  <= triplet_sum /\ 
    x[11] + x[0]  + x[1]  <= triplet_sum
;


output [
    "triplet_sum: ", show(triplet_sum), "\n",
    "       ", show(x[0]), "\n",
    "     ", show(x[11]), "    ", show(x[1]), "\n",
    "   ", show(x[10]), "       ", show(x[2]), "\n",
    "  ", show(x[9]), "         ", show(x[3]), "\n",
    "   ", show(x[8]), "        ",show(x[4]), "\n",
    "     ",  show(x[7]), "    ", show(x[5]), "\n",
    "       ", show(x[6]), "\n",
]
++
[ "x: " ++ show(x) ++ "\n"]
;

Expected Output:
{
  "x": [
    12,
    7,
    1,
    11,
    6,
    4,
    9,
    8,
    3,
    10,
    5,
    2
  ],
  "triplet_sum": 21
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.
