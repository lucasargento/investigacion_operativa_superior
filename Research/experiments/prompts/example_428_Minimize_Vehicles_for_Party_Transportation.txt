You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 428
- Name: Minimize Vehicles for Party Transportation
- Domain: Transportation
- Objective: minimization

Problem Description:
A party organizer needs to transport party goers either by limousine or bus . Limousines can carry 12 people and buses can carry 18 people . They need to transport at least 400 people . Because limousines are more attractive , at least 70 % of the vehicles must be limousines . How many of each type of vehicle should be used to minimize the total number of limousines and buses used ?


MiniZinc Model:
include "globals.mzn";

% Number of limousines and buses
var 0..100: limousines;
var 0..100: buses;

% they need to transport at least 400 people
% limousines can carry 12 people and buses can carry 18 people 
constraint limousines * 12 + buses * 18 >= 400;

% at least 70 % of the vehicles must be limousines
constraint limousines >= 0.7 * (limousines + buses);

% minimize the total number of limousines and buses used
solve minimize limousines + buses;

% output
output ["Number of limousines: ", show(limousines), "\n", "Number of buses: ", show(buses)];

Expected Output:
{
  "limousines": 23,
  "buses": 7,
  "_objective": 30
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
