You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 485
- Name: Rot 13 Caesar Cipher
- Domain: Cryptography
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
The problem is about implementing the Rot 13 (Caesar cipher) in MiniZinc. The Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet. In this case, the shift is 13 places, hence the name Rot 13. The problem has a string of length 10 and an alphabet of length 26. The goal is to find the rotated string and the rotation number such that for each character in the string, the rotated character is the character in the alphabet that is 'rot' places down from the original character. If the rotation goes beyond the end of the alphabet, it wraps around to the beginning.


MiniZinc Model:
int: len = 10;       % string length
int: alpha_len = 26; % length of alphabet

array[1..len] of 1..alpha_len: text;
array[1..len] of var 1..alpha_len: rotated; % the rotated string
var 1..26: rot;       % the rotate number

solve satisfy;

constraint
  forall(i in 1..len) (
    let {
      var 0..alpha_len: m = (text[i] + rot) mod alpha_len
     } 
     in 
       (m = 0 -> rotated[i] = alpha_len)
       /\
       (m > 0 -> rotated[i] = m)
  )
;

%
% data
%
text = [1,2,3,13,14,15,16,24,25,26];

output [
  "text: " ++ show(text) ++ "\n" ++
  "rotated: " ++ show(rotated) ++ "\n" ++
  "rot: " ++ show(rot) ++ "\n"
];

Expected Output:
{
  "rotated": [
    2,
    3,
    4,
    14,
    15,
    16,
    17,
    25,
    26,
    1
  ],
  "rot": 1
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
