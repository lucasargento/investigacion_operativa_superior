Title: Killer Sudoku
Proposer: Peter Nightingale
Category: Games and puzzles
---

Killer Sudoku is a puzzle played on a $\\{9\times 9\\}$ grid containing 81 cells. 
The cells are filled in with numbers from the set $\\{1\ldots 9\\}$.
Each row and column must contain all numbers $\\{1\ldots 9\\}$. Each of the 9
non-overlapping $3\times 3$ subsquares (named *boxes*) must also contain all numbers $\\{1\ldots 9\\}$.

Each Killer Sudoku puzzle has a set of *cages*. A cage is a set of contiguous cells
and a total; the numbers in the cells must add up to the total. Also, the cells in
a cage cannot contain the same number more than once. The cages do not overlap, 
and they cover all cells. Cages typically contain two to four cells. 
Typically a Killer Sudoku puzzle will have exactly one solution. 

An example Killer Sudoku puzzle is shown below. Each cage is shown as an area of one colour.

Generalisation to $n \times n$ grids
------

There is a straightforward generalisation of Killer Sudoku. For any $n$ that has
an integer square root, we have an $n \times n$ grid and each cell takes any
value in $\\{1\ldots n\\}$. In a solution each row and column contains all numbers $\\{1\ldots n\\}$,
and the $n$ non-overlapping $\sqrt{n} \times \sqrt{n}$ boxes also contain all
numbers $\\{1\ldots n\\}$. Cages function in the same way in the generalised 
problem as in the $\\{9\times 9\\}$ problem.

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.
