You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 454
- Name: Atleast NValue Constraint
- Domain: Constraint Programming
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
The problem is about implementing the global constraint 'atleast_nvalue' in MiniZinc. The constraint 'atleast_nvalue' ensures that the number of distinct values taken by the variables of a collection is greater than or equal to a given value 'NVAL'. For example, if we have a collection <3, 1, 7, 1, 6> and NVAL is 2, the constraint holds since the collection involves at least 2 distinct values (in fact, it has 4 distinct values). The task is to define a model that takes an array of integers and a value 'nval', and checks if the array satisfies the 'atleast_nvalue' constraint with 'nval'. The model should also include a helper predicate to convert an array to a set, and a predicate 'cp1d' to ensure that two arrays have the same elements in the same order.


MiniZinc Model:
int: n = 5;
array[1..n] of var 1..7: x;
var int: nval;

%
% helper predicate to convert an array to a set
%
predicate array2set(array[int] of var int: x, var set of int: s) =

   forall(i in index_set(x)) (  x[i] in s ) /\
   % secure that the values _not_ in x is _not_ in s
   forall(i in lb_array(x)..ub_array(x)) (
     (not exists(j in index_set(x)) (x[j] = i ) <-> not (i in s))
   )
;

predicate atleast_nvalue(var int: nval, array[int] of var int: x) =
  let {
    var set of lb_array(x)..ub_array(x): s
  }
  in
  array2set(x, s)
  /\
  card(s) >= nval
;

predicate cp1d(array[int] of int: x, array[int] of var int: y) =
  assert(index_set(x) = index_set(y),
           "cp1d: x and y have different sizes",
    forall(i in index_set(x)) (
      x[i] = y[i]
    )
  )
; 


solve satisfy;

constraint
  cp1d([3, 1, 7, 1, 6], x)
  /\
  atleast_nvalue(nval, x)
  /\
  nval = 2

;


output
[
  "x: \(x)\nnval: \(nval)\n"
];

Expected Output:
{
  "x": [
    3,
    1,
    7,
    1,
    6
  ],
  "nval": 2
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
