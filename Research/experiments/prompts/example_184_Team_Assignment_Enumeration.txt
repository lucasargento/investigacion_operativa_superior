You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 184
- Name: Team Assignment Enumeration
- Domain: Combinatorial Optimization
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
Given a group of people, the problem is to divide them into 'm' teams of size 'n'. The total number of people is 'nm'. The task is to enumerate all the ways this can be done. The order of elements within each subset does not matter, and the order of the subsets doesn't matter. This means that a team of Alice and Bob is the same as a team of Bob and Alice, and Alice-Bob versus Charlie-David is the same as Charlie-David versus Alice-Bob. The number of ways of doing this is calculated as (nm)!/n!mm!. This problem uses a variant representation where 'x' is a m*n array with decision variables of 1..m, i.e., the assignments of the team to a person. The constraints ensure that there are exactly 'n' members in each team and the first occurrences of the team numbers (1..m) must be in order.


MiniZinc Model:
include "globals.mzn"; 

int: m = 4; % number of teams
int: n = 4; % size of team

int: p = m*n; % number of people: m*n

%
% (n*m)! /(((n!)^m)*m!)
% 
% m   n   #sol
% -----------
% 1  1  1
% 1  2  1
% 1  3  1
% 1  4  1
% 2  1  1
% 2  2  3
% 2  3  10
% 2  4  35
% 3  1  1
% 3  2  15
% 3  3  280
% 3  4  5775
% 4  1  1
% 4  2  105
% 4  3  15400
% 4  4  2627625


% decision variables
array[1..p] of var 1..m: x; % assign each person to a team number

% solve satisfy;
solve :: int_search(x, input_order, indomain_min, complete) satisfy;

function int: factorial(int: n) =  product([i | i in 1..n]);

constraint
   trace("m: " ++ show(m) ++ " n: " ++ show(n) ++ ": " ++ 
         show(factorial(n*m) div (( pow(factorial(n),m)*factorial(m)))) ++ "\n", true)
;

constraint
  % ensure that there are exactly n members in the team
  global_cardinality(x, [i | i in 1..m], [n | j in 1..m])

  /\ % symmetry breaking: 
     % the first occurrences of the team numbers (1..m) must be in order
  value_precede_chain([i | i in 1..m],x)
;

output [
  show(x)
];

Expected Output:
{
  "x": [
    1,
    1,
    1,
    1,
    2,
    2,
    2,
    2,
    3,
    3,
    3,
    3,
    4,
    4,
    4,
    4
  ]
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.
