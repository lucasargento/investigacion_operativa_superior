You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 407
- Name: Maximize Construction Equipment Production Profit
- Domain: Manufacturing
- Objective: maximization

Problem Description:
A construction company makes bulldozers and forklifts . Each bulldozer takes 3 hours on the assembly line and 2 hours of QC time . Each forklift takes 2 hours on the assembly line and 1.5 hours of QC time . There are 600 hours of assembly line time available and 400 hours of QC time available . If the profit per bulldozer is $ 7000 and the profit per forklift is $ 6000 , how many of each should the construction company make to maximize profit ?


MiniZinc Model:
include "globals.mzn";

% number of bulldozers and forklifts
var int: bulldozers;
var int: forklifts;

% units are non-negative
constraint bulldozers >= 0;
constraint forklifts >= 0;

% 600 hours of assembly time are available
% bulldozers take 3 hours on the assembly line and forklifts take 2 hours
constraint bulldozers * 3 + forklifts * 2 <= 600;

% 400 hours of QC time are available
% bulldozers take 2 hours of QC time and forklifts take 1.5 hours
constraint bulldozers * 2 + forklifts * 1.5 <= 400;

% profit from bulldozers is 7000 each and from forklifts is 6000 each
var int: profit = bulldozers * 7000 + forklifts * 6000;

% maximize profit
solve maximize profit;

% Output
output ["Number of bulldozers: ", show(bulldozers), "\n", "Number of forklifts: ", show(forklifts), "\n", "Maximum profit: $", show(profit)];

Expected Output:
{
  "bulldozers": 2,
  "forklifts": 264,
  "_objective": 1598000
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
