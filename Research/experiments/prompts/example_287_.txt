You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 287
- Name: 
- Domain: 
- Objective: 

Problem Description:
# Problem Square

There is one four-digit whole number x, such that the last four digits of x^2
are in fact the original number x. What is it?

## Data
  all integrated (single problem)

## Execution
```
  python Square.py
```

MiniZinc Model:
include "globals.mzn";

var 1000..9999: x;

constraint (x*x mod 10000) = x;

solve satisfy;

output ["The four-digit integer is: ", show(x)];

Expected Output:
{
  "x": 9376
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
