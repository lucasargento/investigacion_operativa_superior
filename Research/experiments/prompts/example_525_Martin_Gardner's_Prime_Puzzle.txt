You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 525
- Name: Martin Gardner's Prime Puzzle
- Domain: Mathematical Puzzles
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
This problem is known as Martin Gardner's Prime puzzle. The task is to solve the operation: mP * nP = (m+n)P, where mP and nP are strings of m and n prime digits (2,3,5 or 7) respectively. The length of mP is 4 and the length of nP is 3. The goal is to find the values of mP, nP and (m+n)P that satisfy the operation.


MiniZinc Model:
int: M; % length of m
int: N; % length of n

set of int: p = {2,3,5,7};
var int: mP;
array[1..M] of var p: mP_a;
var int: nP;
array[1..N] of var p: nP_a;

var int: mnP;
array[1..M+N] of var p: mnP_a;


% solve satisfy;
solve :: int_search(mP_a ++ nP_a ++ mnP_a ++ [mP, nP, mnP], first_fail, indomain_min, complete) satisfy;

predicate toNum(array[int] of var int: n_a, var int: n_sum) =
          let { int: len = length(n_a) }
          in
          n_sum = sum(i in 1..len) (
            ceil(pow(10.0, int2float(len-i))) * n_a[i]
          )
          /\ forall(i in 1..len) (n_a[i] >= 0)
;


constraint

   toNum(mP_a, mP) 
   /\
   toNum(nP_a, nP) 
   /\
   toNum(mnP_a, mnP) 
   /\
   mP * nP = mnP

;

% output [
%   "mP: ", show(mP),"\n",
%   "nP: ", show(nP),"\n",
%   "mnP: ", show(mnP),"\n",
% ];

output [
   show(mP), " * ", show(nP), " = ", show(mnP), "\n"
];


%
% data 
%
M = 4;
N = 3;

Expected Output:
{
  "mP": 3235,
  "mP_a": [
    3,
    2,
    3,
    5
  ],
  "nP": 735,
  "nP_a": [
    7,
    3,
    5
  ],
  "mnP": 2377725,
  "mnP_a": [
    2,
    3,
    7,
    7,
    7,
    2,
    5
  ]
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.
