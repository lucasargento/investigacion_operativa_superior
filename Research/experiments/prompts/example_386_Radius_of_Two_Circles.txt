You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 386
- Name: Radius of Two Circles
- Domain: Geometry
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
The problem is about two circles. The sum of their circumferences is equal to 10322*Pi and the sum of their areas is equal to 13946281*Pi. The task is to find the radius of each circle. The area of a circle is calculated as Pi*r^2 and the circumference as 2*Pi*r. The radius of each circle is a real number between 0 and 10000. The radius of the first circle should be less than or equal to the radius of the second circle.


MiniZinc Model:
float: pi = 3.141592653589793;

function var float: area(var float: r) = pi*r*r;
function var float: circumference(var float: r) = 2*pi*r;

% decision variables
var 0.0..10000.0: r1;
var 0.0..10000.0: r2;

solve satisfy;

constraint
  r1 <= r2 /\

  circumference(r1) + circumference(r2) = 10322*pi /\
  area(r1) +area(r2) = 13946281*pi
;

% output [

% ];

Expected Output:
{
  "r1": 2020.00000000001,
  "r2": 3141.0
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
