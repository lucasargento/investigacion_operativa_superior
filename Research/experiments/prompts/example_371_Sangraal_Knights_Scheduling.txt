You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 371
- Name: Sangraal Knights Scheduling
- Domain: Scheduling
- Objective: maximization

Problem Description:
The problem is a scheduling problem from a fantasy game called Sangraal. The player arrives at a castle where the Foul Fiend has imprisoned 8 knights. Each knight is bound in a different way and has different injuries, which affects the time it takes to free them and the time they need to recover. The state of binding means that it will take 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 minutes (respectively) to free them. A freed knight then goes away to wash and recover himself physically in time for the Sangraal's arrival. The time he takes for this second stage is 5, 10 or 15 minutes, according to injury. In twenty minutes' time the sun will set and the Sangraal will arrive. The goal is to maximize the number of knights that can be freed and prepared within 20 minutes. The problem is modeled as an integer programming problem where the decision variables represent whether a knight is in a certain position and whether a position is finished within 20 minutes. The objective is to maximize the number of positions finished within 20 minutes.


MiniZinc Model:
int: k = 8;

set of int: knight = 1..k;
set of int: posit = 1..k;

array[knight] of int: free; % time to free each knight
array[knight] of int: prep; % time to prepare each knight

array[knight, posit] of var 0..1: x; % x(i,j)=1 if knight i in position j, 0 otherwise
array[posit] of var 0..1: d; % d(j)=1 if position j finished within 20 minutes, 0 otherwise
array[posit] of var int: t; % finish time for each position

% maximise number of positions finished within 20 minutes
var int: maxk = sum(j in posit) (d[j]);

solve :: int_search([x[i,j] | i in knight, j in posit ], 
        first_fail, indomain_min, complete) maximize maxk;

constraint  
  % each knight in one position
  forall(i in knight) (
     sum(j in posit) (x[i,j]) = 1     
  )
  /\
  % each position has one knight
  forall(j in posit) (
     sum(i in knight) (x[i,j]) = 1 
  )
  /\
  % compute finish time for each position
  forall(j in posit) (
    (sum(i in knight, l in 1..j-1) (free[i]*x[i,l]) + 
     sum(i in knight) ((free[i]+prep[i])*x[i,j])) = t[j]
  )
  /\
  % d(j) = 1 if knight in position j is freed and prepared within 20 minutes
  forall(j in posit) (
    t[j] >= 21-15*d[j]
    /\
    t[j] <= 53-33*d[j]
  )
;

output 
[
  if j = 1 then "\n" else " " endif ++
    show(x[i,j])
  | i in knight, j in posit
]
++
[
  "\nt: ", show(t) ++ "\n",
  "d: ", show(d) ++ "\n",
  "maxk: ", show(maxk)
];

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
