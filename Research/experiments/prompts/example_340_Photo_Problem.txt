You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 340
- Name: Photo Problem
- Domain: Scheduling
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
The problem is a photo problem modeled in MiniZinc. The problem involves 11 positions and 20 preferences. The goal is to find a solution that satisfies the given preferences. The preferences are given as a 2D array where each row represents a preference between two positions. The problem is solved using integer search with 'first_fail', 'indomain_min', and 'complete' as parameters. The problem also includes a constraint that the solution must be greater than or equal to 12. The problem is solved to satisfaction, not optimization. The output of the problem is the solution and the positions.


MiniZinc Model:
include "photo_hkj2_model.mzn";

n = 11;
num_pref = 20;

% solve :: int_search(positions, "first_fail", "indomain", "complete") maximize z;
solve :: int_search(positions, first_fail, indomain_min, complete) satisfy;

% for solve satisfy
% constraint 
%   z >= 12
% ;

% The preference list from 
% http://www.g12.cs.mu.oz.au/minizinc/photo.data2
preferences =
array2d(1..num_pref, 1..2, [ 
  0,2, 0,4, 0,7, 
  1,4, 1,8, 
  2,3, 2,4, 
  3,0, 3,4, 3,9,
  4,5, 4,0, 
  5,0, 5,8, 
  6,2, 6,7, 
  7,8, 7,6, 
  8,9, 
  9,10
]);



output [
   show(z), ": ", show(positions), "\n",
];

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
