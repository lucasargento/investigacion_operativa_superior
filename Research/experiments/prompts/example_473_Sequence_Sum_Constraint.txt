You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 473
- Name: Sequence Sum Constraint
- Domain: Constraints
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
The problem is about constraining all sequences of a given length (SEQ) from a collection of variables such that the sum of the variables in each sequence falls within a specified interval [LOW, UP]. For example, given a sequence length of 4 and a collection of variables <1, 4, 2, 0, 0, 3, 4>, the problem is to ensure that the sum of every 4 consecutive values in the collection is between 3 and 7. The constraint holds if the sums associated with the subsequences 1 4 2 0, 4 2 0 0, 2 0 0 3, and 0 0 3 4 are respectively 7, 6, 5 and 7, all of which are within the interval [3, 7].


MiniZinc Model:
int: n = 7;
array[1..n] of var 0..4: variables;
var 0..10: low;
var 0..10: up;
1..n: seq = 4;

predicate sliding_sum(var int: low, var int: up, int: seq, array[int] of var int: variables) =
  forall(i in min(index_set(variables))..max(index_set(variables))-seq+1) (
    let {
      var int: s
    }
    in
    s = sum(j in i..i+seq-1) (
      variables[j]
    )
    /\
    s >= low
    /\
    s <= up
  )
;

predicate cp1d(array[int] of var int: x, array[int] of var int: y) =
  assert(index_set(x) = index_set(y),
           "cp1d: x and y have different sizes",
     forall(i in index_set(x)) ( x[i] = y[i] ))
; 


solve satisfy;

constraint
  % cp1d(variables, [1,4,2,0,0,3,3])
  % /\
  low = 3
  /\
  up = 7
  /\
  sliding_sum(low, up, seq, variables)
;

output [
"low: " ++ show(low) ++ "\n"++
"up: " ++ show(up) ++ "\n"++
"seq: " ++ show(seq) ++ "\n"++
"variables: " ++ show(variables) ++ "\n"
];

Expected Output:
{
  "variables": [
    0,
    3,
    0,
    0,
    0,
    3,
    0
  ],
  "low": 3,
  "up": 7
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
