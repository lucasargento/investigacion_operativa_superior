You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 316
- Name: Non-dominating Queens Puzzle
- Domain: Puzzles
- Objective: minimization

Problem Description:
The Non-dominating queens puzzle is a variation of the classic N-Queens problem. The problem is to place N queens on an NxN chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other and the number of squares that are attacked or occupied is minimized. A square is considered attacked if it is in the same row, column, or diagonal as a queen. The objective is to minimize the number of squares that are either occupied by a queen or are under attack by a queen. The problem is defined on a 5x5 chessboard in this case.


MiniZinc Model:
int: size = 5;
set of 1..size: S = 1..size;

% var x(S,S) binary;  #  x(i,j) = 1 if square (i,j) occupied, 0 otherwise
array[S,S] of var 0..1: x;
% var a(S,S) binary;  # a(i,j) = 1 if square (i,j) attacked, 0 otherwise
array[S,S] of var 0..1: a;

var int: numa = sum(i in S, j in S) (a[i,j]);

% minimize number of squares attacked or occupied
% solve minimize numa;
solve :: int_search(
        [a[i,j] | i,j in S] ++ [x[i,j] | i,j in S], 
        first_fail, 
        indomain_min, 
        complete) 
    minimize numa;

constraint
  % number of pieces placed equals size of board
  sum(i in S,j in S) (x[i,j]) = size

  /\  % a[i,j) = 1 if square (i,j) attacked or occupied
  forall(i in S, j in S) (
      (sum(m in S where m != i /\ m-i+j >= 1 /\ m-i+j <= size) (x[m,m-i+j]) +
       sum(m in S where m != i /\ i+j-m >= 1 /\ i+j-m <= size) (x[m,i+j-m]) +
       sum(m in S) (x[m,j]) + 
       sum(m in S  where  m != j) (x[i,m]) +
       x[i,j]
      ) 
       <= size*a[i,j]
  )
  /\ % a[i,j) = 0 if square (i,j) not attacked or occupied
  forall(i in S,j in S) (
       (sum(m in S  where  m != i /\ m-i+j >= 1 /\ m-i+j <= size) (x[m,m-i+j]) +
        sum(m in S  where  m != i /\ i+j-m >= 1 /\ i+j-m <= size) (x[m,i+j-m]) +
        sum(m in S) (x[m,j]) + 
        sum(m in S  where  m != j) (x[i,m]) +
        x[i,j]) 
        >= a[i,j] 
  )
;

output

 "\nnuma: " ++ show(numa)  ++ "\n"

   if j = 1 /\ i = 1 then 
     "\n: x\n"

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.
