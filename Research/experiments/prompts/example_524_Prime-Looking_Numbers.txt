You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 524
- Name: Prime-Looking Numbers
- Domain: Number Theory
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
The problem is based on a Martin Gardner Problem. A number is called 'prime-looking' if it is composite but not divisible by 2, 3, or 5. The three smallest prime-looking numbers are 49, 77, and 91. There are 168 prime numbers less than 1000. The problem is to find how many prime-looking numbers are there less than 1000. The problem is modeled in MiniZinc, a medium-level constraint modeling language. The model includes two variables, d1 and d2, which are factors of a number x. The number x is considered 'prime-looking' if it is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5. The goal is to find the number x that satisfies these conditions.


MiniZinc Model:
int: n = 999;
var 2..n: x;
var 2..n: d1;
var 2..n: d2;

% solve satisfy;
% solve minimize x;
solve :: int_search([x,d1,d2], first_fail, indomain_min, complete) satisfy;

constraint
   x = d1*d2 /\ d1 <= d2
   /\
   forall(i in {2,3,5}) (
      x mod i > 0
   )
;

output [
  "x: " ++ show(x) ++ " (" ++ show(d1) ++ "*" ++ show(d2) ++ ")\n"
]
 ++ ["\n"]
;

Expected Output:
{
  "x": 49,
  "d1": 7,
  "d2": 7
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
