You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 481
- Name: Permutation Number and Parity
- Domain: Combinatorics
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
The problem is about finding permutations and their corresponding permutation numbers. A permutation number is the number of transpositions in a permutation. The problem requires to find an array 'x' of size 'n' such that all elements in 'x' are different and satisfy a certain permutation number. The permutation number is calculated by counting the number of elements in the array 'x' that are lower than the current element for each element in the array. The problem also requires to determine if the permutation number is even or odd. The solution should output the array 'x', the permutation number, and whether the permutation number is even or odd.


MiniZinc Model:
include "globals.mzn"; 
int: n = 6;
array[1..n] of var 1..n: x;
% array[1..n] of var 0..n: transpositions; % number of reversals
var 0..n: perm_num; % if the permutation is even/odd
var 0..1: even_odd; % if the permutation is even/odd

predicate permutation_number(array[int] of var int: x, var int: perm_num) =
  let {
    int: n = card(index_set(x)),
    array[1..n] of var 0..n: transpositions2
  } in
  forall(i in 1..n) (
     % count the number of elements in i+1 which are lower than
     % x[i]. This is the number of reversals
     transpositions2[i] = sum(j in i+1..n) (
        bool2int(x[j] < x[i])
     )
  )
  /\
  perm_num = sum(transpositions2)

;

% solve satisfy;
solve :: int_search(x, first_fail, indomain_min, complete) satisfy;


constraint
  all_different(x)
  /\
  permutation_number(x, perm_num)
  /\
  even_odd = perm_num mod 2
  %/\ perm_num = 2
  %/\ perm_num = 1
 
;

output
[
  "x: " ++ show(x) ++ "\n" ++
  "perm_num: " ++ show(perm_num) ++ "\n" ++
  "even_odd: " ++ show(even_odd) ++ "\n"
];

Expected Output:
{
  "x": [
    1,
    2,
    3,
    4,
    5,
    6
  ],
  "perm_num": 0,
  "even_odd": 0
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.
