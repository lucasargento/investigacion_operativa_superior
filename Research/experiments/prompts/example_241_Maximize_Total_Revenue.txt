You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 241
- Name: Maximize Total Revenue
- Domain: Economics
- Objective: maximization

Problem Description:
A firm produces M different goods using N different raw materials. The firm has Available amount of raw material i available. Good j requires Requirements units of material i per unit produced. Good j results in a revenue of Prices per unit produced. How much of each good should the firm produce in order to maximize its total revenue?


Input Data (data.dzn):
M = 4;
N = 5;
Available = [10, 20, 15, 35, 25];
Requirements = [|3, 2, 0, 0, 0|0, 5, 2, 1, 0|1, 0, 0, 5, 3|0, 3, 1, 1, 5|];
Prices = [7, 10, 5, 9];

MiniZinc Model:
% Parameters
int: M; % Number of goods
int: N; % Number of raw materials
array[1..N] of int: Available; % Available amount of each raw material
array[1..M, 1..N] of int: Requirements; % Requirements of each raw material for each good
array[1..M] of int: Prices; % Price of each good

% Decision Variables
array[1..M] of var 0..sum(Available): amount; % Amount of each good to produce

% Objective
maximize sum(j in 1..M)(amount[j] * Prices[j]);

% Constraints
constraint forall(i in 1..N)(
    sum(j in 1..M)(Requirements[j, i] * amount[j]) <= Available[i]
);

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
