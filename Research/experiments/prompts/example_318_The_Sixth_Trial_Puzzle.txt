Problem Information:
- Example Number: 318
- Name: The Sixth Trial Puzzle
- Domain: Puzzles
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
The problem is a puzzle known as 'The Sixth Trial' from Smullyan, R., (1991), The Lady or The Tiger, Oxford University Press. The puzzle involves two doors and two prizes, a lady and a tiger. Each door hides one prize. The statements on the doors provide clues about what is behind the doors. The statement on door i is true if and only if door i hides prize i. If the statement on door 1 is true (i.e., if the prizes behind doors 1 and 2 are the same), then the variable t[1] is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to 0. Similarly, if the statement on door 2 is true, then the variable t[2] is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to 0. The goal is to find a configuration of prizes behind the doors that satisfies all these conditions.


MiniZinc Model:
int: door = 2;
int: prize = 2;		% 1 = Lady, 2 = Tiger

set of 1..door: D = 1..door;
set of 1..prize: P = 1..prize;
array[D,P] of var 0..1: x;   % x(i,j) = 1 if door i hides prize j, else 0
array[D] of var 0..1: t;    % t(i) = 1 if statement on door i is true, else 0
array[1..2] of var 0..1: d;    % dummy variables

solve satisfy;

constraint
  % each door hides 1 prize
  forall(i in D) (
    sum(j in P) (x[i,j]) = 1 
  )
  /\ % if door i hides prize i then statement i is true else false
  forall(i in D) (
    x[i,i] = t[i]
  )

  /\ % if statement on door 1 is true [i.e. x[1,1]=x[2,1]] then set t[1] = 1, else t[1] = 0
  x[1,1]-x[2,1]-2*d[1] <= -1  /\
  x[1,1]-x[2,1]-d[1] >= -1 /\

  x[1,1]-x[2,1]+2*d[2] >= 1 /\ 
  x[1,1]-x[2,1]+2*d[2] <= 2 /\ 

  d[1]+d[2]-t[1] <= 1 /\ 
  d[1]+d[2]-2*t[1] >= 0 

  /\  % if statement on door 2 is true then set t[2] = 1, else t[2] = 0
  x[1,1] = t[2]
;

output 
[
  if j = 1 then "\n" else " " endif ++
    show(x[i,j])
  | i in D, j in P
] ++
[
 if i = 1 then "\n" else "" endif ++
 show(t[i]) ++ "\n"
 | i in D
];

Expected Output:
{
  "x": [
    [
      0,
      1
    ],
    [
      1,
      0
    ]
  ],
  "t": [
    0,
    0
  ],
  "d": [
    0,
    1
  ]
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.
