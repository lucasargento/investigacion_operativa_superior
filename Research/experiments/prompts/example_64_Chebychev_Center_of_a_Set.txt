You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 64
- Name: Chebychev Center of a Set
- Domain: Mathematical Modeling
- Objective: maximization

Problem Description:
Consider a set P described by linear inequality constraints, that is:

P = {x \in R^N | {a_i}^T x <= b_i , i = 1, ..., m}.

where a_i \in R^N and b_i \in R

A ball with center y in R^N and radius r is defined as the set of all points within (Euclidean) distance r from y. We are interested in finding a ball with the largest possible radius, which is entirely contained within the set P (The center of such a ball is called the Chebychev center of P). 


Input Data (data.dzn):
M = 4;
N = 2;
A = array2d(1..4, 1..2, [1.0, 0.0, -1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, -1.0]);
B = [2.0, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0];


MiniZinc Model:
% Empty model file

Expected Output:
{
  "_objective": 2.0
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
