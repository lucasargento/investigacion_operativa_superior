You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 461
- Name: Cardinality Atleast Constraint
- Domain: Constraints
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
The problem is about implementing the global constraint cardinality_atleast in MiniZinc. The cardinality_atleast constraint is defined as the minimum number of times that a value from a given set of values is taken by the variables of a given collection. The constraint holds if the first argument, ATLEAST, is assigned to the minimum number of times that the values from the given set occur in the collection. For example, given the values 3 and 8 and the collection <3, 3, 8>, the values 3 and 8 are respectively used 2, and 1 times. The cardinality_atleast constraint holds since its first argument ATLEAST = 1 is assigned to the minimum number of times that values 3 and 8 occur in the collection <3, 3, 8>.


MiniZinc Model:
int: n = 3;
int: m = 2;
array[1..n] of var 1..8: variables;
array[1..m] of var 1..8: values;
var 0..8: nvar;

predicate cardinality_atleast(var int: nvar, array[int] of var int: variables, array[int] of var int: values) =
   forall(i in index_set(values)) (
     sum(j in index_set(variables)) (bool2int(values[i] = variables[j])) >= nvar
   )

;

predicate cp1d(array[int] of int: x, array[int] of var int: y) =
  assert(index_set(x) = index_set(y),
           "cp1d: x and y have different sizes",
    forall(i in index_set(x)) (
        x[i] = y[i]
    )
  )
; 


solve satisfy;

constraint

   cp1d([3,3,8],variables)
   /\
   cp1d([3,8], values)
   /\
   nvar = 1
   /\
   cardinality_atleast(nvar, variables, values)
;

output
[
  "variables: " ++ show(variables) ++ "\n" ++
  "nvar: " ++ show(nvar) ++ "\n" ++ 
  "values: " ++ show(values)
];

Expected Output:
{
  "variables": [
    3,
    3,
    8
  ],
  "values": [
    3,
    8
  ],
  "nvar": 1
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
