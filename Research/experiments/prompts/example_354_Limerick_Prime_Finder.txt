You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 354
- Name: Limerick Prime Finder
- Domain: Number Theory
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
The problem is about finding Limerick primes. A Limerick prime has to have the form AABBA where A is an odd digit and B is any digit other than A. The task is to find such primes in the range of 10000 to 99999. The problem is solved when a prime number that satisfies these conditions is found.


MiniZinc Model:
int: n = 5;

var 10000..99999: p;
array[1..n] of var 0..9: x;


predicate is_prime(var int: x) =
   x > 1 
   /\
   forall(i in 2..1+ceil(sqrt(int2float(ub(x))))) ( 
        (i < x) -> (x mod i > 0)
   )
;

% channel array a <-> var int n
predicate toNum10(array[int] of var int: a, var int: n) =
          let { int: len = length(a) }
          in
          n = sum(i in 1..len) (
            ceil(pow(10.0, int2float(len-i))) * a[i]
          )
          /\ forall(i in 1..len) (a[i] >= 0)
;


% solve satisfy;
solve :: int_search(x, first_fail, indomain_min, complete) satisfy;

constraint
   is_prime(p) /\ toNum10(x, p)
;

% """

constraint
   x[1] mod 2 = 1
   /\ % AA..A
   x[1] = x[2] /\ x[1] = x[5]
   /\ % ..BB.
   x[3] = x[4]
   /\ 
   x[1] != x[3]
;

output [
  "p: " ++ show(p) ++ "\n" ++
  "x: " ++ show(x)
]
 ++ ["\n"]
;

Expected Output:
{
  "p": 11551,
  "x": [
    1,
    1,
    5,
    5,
    1
  ]
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
