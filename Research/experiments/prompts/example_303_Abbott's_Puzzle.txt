You are an expert in translating MiniZinc models to Python using OR-Tools. Your task is to translate the following optimization problem:

Problem Information:
- Example Number: 303
- Name: Abbott's Puzzle
- Domain: Mathematical Puzzles
- Objective: satisfaction

Problem Description:
The Abbott's Puzzle is a problem from the book 'Amusements in Mathematics' by H.E. Dudeney (1917). The problem is to find a solution for three variables x[1], x[2], and x[3] that satisfy the following conditions: 
1. The sum of each variable multiplied by its corresponding amount (6, 4, 1 respectively) equals 200. 
2. The sum of the variables equals 100. 
3. The second variable is five times the first variable. 
The variables are integers and can take values between 0 and 1000.


MiniZinc Model:
set of int: S = 1..3;
% array[S] of 0.0..3.0: amount = [3.0, 2.0, 0.5]; % float version
array[S] of 0..6: amount = [6, 4, 1]; % multiply with 2 for the integer solution
array[S] of var 0..1000: x;

solve satisfy;

constraint
   % float version
   % sum(i in S) (amount[i]*int2float(x[i])) = 100.0
   % /\
   % sum(i in S) (x[i]) = 100
   % /\
   % x[2] = 5*x[1]

   % integer version
   sum(i in S) (amount[i]*x[i]) = 200
   /\
   sum(i in S) (x[i]) = 100
   /\
   x[2] = 5*x[1]
;

output [
  show(x), "\n",
];

Expected Output:
{
  "x": [
    5,
    25,
    70
  ]
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.
