MiniZinc Model:
include "globals.mzn";

% Define the variables
var 0..9: S; var 0..9: E; var 0..9: N; var 0..9: D; var 0..9: M; var 0..9: O; var 0..9: R; var 0..9: Y;

% Define the constraints
constraint alldifferent([S, E, N, D, M, O, R, Y]);
constraint S != 0;
constraint M != 0;
constraint 1000*S + 100*E + 10*N + D + 1000*M + 100*O + 10*R + E = 10000*M + 1000*O + 100*N + 10*E + Y;

% Define the objective function
solve satisfy;

% Output the solution
output ["S=", show(S), " E=", show(E), " N=", show(N), " D=", show(D), " M=", show(M), " O=", show(O), " R=", show(R), " Y=", show(Y)];

Expected Output:
{
  "S": 9,
  "E": 5,
  "N": 6,
  "D": 7,
  "M": 1,
  "O": 0,
  "R": 8,
  "Y": 2
}

Instructions:
1. If a MiniZinc model is provided, translate it directly to Python using OR-Tools.
2. If no MiniZinc model is provided, first create a MiniZinc model and then translate it to Python.
3. The Python code should be complete and executable as-is.
4. Include all necessary imports and dependencies.
5. Define all variables before use.
6. Use explicit loops instead of list comprehensions.
7. Ensure the solution matches the expected output format.
8. Include comments explaining key parts of the implementation.

Please provide the complete Python code that solves this optimization problem using OR-Tools.
