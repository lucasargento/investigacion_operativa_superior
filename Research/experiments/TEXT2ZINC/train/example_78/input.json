  "description": "The capacitated facility location problem involves locating facilities which are to service customers at minimum total cost. Considering potential facility locations and customer zones as fixed points in a network, each facility has a fixed cost and a fixed capacity. Furthermore, each customer zone has a specific demand, and there is a transportation cost associated with shipping goods from a facility to a customer zone. The objective is to minimize total cost by choosing which facilities to establish and determining how much each facility should supply to each customer zone.",
