  "description": "There are some products to be produced, each of which passes through several stages of production. For each product and stage of production, we are given the amount of time it takes for 1 unit of product to pass through the stage of production. Each stage of production has a maximum number of working hours and each product has a profit associated with its production. Determine the quantities to be produced such that all the production constraints are satisfied and the profit is maximized.",
