  "description": "The Balanced Academic Curriculum Problem (BACP) aims to create a balanced academic curriculum by assigning courses to periods in a way that balances the academic load of each period. Given minimum and maximum load per period, we must ensure the every period has a load within these limits. Additionally, we must ensure that the number of courses for each period is within the upper and lower bounds mentioned. Given the number of academic periods available, and a list of courses along with their loads, devise a schedule that meets these constraints and minimizes the maximum courseload across all periods.",
