  "description": "The problem is based on a Martin Gardner Problem. A number is called 'prime-looking' if it is composite but not divisible by 2, 3, or 5. The three smallest prime-looking numbers are 49, 77, and 91. There are 168 prime numbers less than 1000. The problem is to find how many prime-looking numbers are there less than 1000. The problem is modeled in MiniZinc, a medium-level constraint modeling language. The model includes two variables, d1 and d2, which are factors of a number x. The number x is considered 'prime-looking' if it is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5. The goal is to find the number x that satisfies these conditions.",
