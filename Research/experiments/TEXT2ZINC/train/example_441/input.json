  "description": "Lot-sizing problems are production planning problems where Periods are predefined and production of an item during a Periods involves a discrete event such as the payment of a cost or the loss of production capacity. These events can occur due to the placement of an order or the set-up, startup, or changeover of a machine. The demand for each of the Items across each period is represented by Demand_{i,j}, while the total production capacity available in each period is defined by TotalPeriodCapacity_j. Each item has a specific capacity ItemCapacity_{i,j} which could decrease in each period due to mentioned events. Holding costs for items are indicated by HoldingCost_i, while backorder costs and fixed order costs are represented by BackorderCost_i and FixedCost_i, respectively. The initial stock of each item is provided by InitialStock_i.",
