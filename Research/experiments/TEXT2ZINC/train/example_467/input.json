  "description": "The problem is to find a solution for the 'minimum_weight_alldifferent' constraint. This constraint requires that all variables in a given collection should take a distinct value located within the interval [1, |VARIABLES|]. In addition, a cost is calculated which is equal to the sum of the costs associated with assigning value i to variable j. These costs are given by a matrix. The goal is to minimize this cost. An example of this problem would be a set of variables <2, 3, 1, 4> and a matrix of costs. The minimum_weight_alldifferent constraint holds since the cost 17 corresponds to the sum of certain elements in the matrix. The problem is solved using the MiniZinc modeling language, which includes global constraints and built-in predicates for handling arrays and matrices.",
