  "description": "This problem is focused on efficiently allocating goods from a set of origins to a set of destinations. Each origin has a certain supply of goods, and each destination has a specific demand. There is a cost associated with transporting goods from an origin to a destination per unit of good. The objective is to minimize the total transportation cost while meeting the demands at the destinations without exceeding the supplies at the origins.",
