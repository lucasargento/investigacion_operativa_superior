  "description": "Given a group of n items, each with a distinct value V(i), the problem is to find the best way to divide the items into k groups such that the group with the highest total value is minimized. The total value of a group is the sum of the values of the items in that group. The goal is to find the value of this largest group. The problem is similar to the 0-1 knapsack problem, but in 2D.",
