  "description": "A portfolio manager with a fixed budget of $100 million is considering eight investment opportunities. The manager must choose an investment level for each alternative ranging from $0 to $40 million. The permissible allocations are discretized to intervals of $10 million. A unit of investment is defined as $10 million. The budget is 10 and the amounts to invest are the integers in the range from 0 to 4. The net annual returns from the investment opportunities are expressed in millions of dollars. A ninth opportunity, not shown in the table, is available for funds left over from the first eight investments. The return is 5% per year for the amount invested, or equivalently, $0.5 million for each $10 million invested. The manager's goal is to maximize the total annual return without exceeding the budget. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program with the objective function being nonlinear. The problem is similar in structure to the knapsack problem.",
