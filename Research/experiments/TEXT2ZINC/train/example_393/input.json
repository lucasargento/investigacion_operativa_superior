  "description": "The problem is to find the intersection of a circle and a parabola. The circle is defined by the equation x^2 + y^2 = 1 and the parabola is defined by the equation x^2 = y. The goal is to find the values of x and y that satisfy both equations. The problem is solved using a constraint satisfaction approach, where the constraints are the two equations. The solution space is searched using a floating point search strategy with a precision of 0.00000000000001. The output is the values of x and y that satisfy the constraints.",
