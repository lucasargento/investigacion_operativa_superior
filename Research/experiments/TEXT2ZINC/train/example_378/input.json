  "description": "This problem is taken from the Numerica book, page 19. The problem is to find a value for 'x' that satisfies the equation x^4 - 12x^3 + 47x^2 - 60x + 24 = 0. The value of 'x' is a floating point number in the range of 0.0 to 10^8. The problem has multiple solutions, with some of them being duplicates. The goal is to find all unique solutions.",
