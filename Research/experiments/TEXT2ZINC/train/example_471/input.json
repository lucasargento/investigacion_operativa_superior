  "description": "The problem is about a constraint called 'sum_of_weights_of_distinct_values'. This constraint is applied to a collection of variables, a collection of values, and a cost. All variables in the VARIABLES collection take a value in the VALUES collection. In addition, COST is the sum of the weight attributes associated with the distinct values taken by the variables of VARIABLES. For example, if VARIABLES = <1,6,1>, VALUES = <val-1 weight-5, val-2 weight-3, val-6 weight-7>, and COST = 12, the constraint holds since COST=12 is equal to the sum 5+7 of the weights of the values 1 and 6 that occur within the VARIABLES collection. The goal is to find the variables, values, and cost that satisfy this constraint.",
