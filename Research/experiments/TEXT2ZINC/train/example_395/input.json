  "description": "The Birthday Paradox, or Birthday Problem, is a problem in probability theory that pertains to the probability that in a set of randomly chosen people, some pair of them will have the same birthday. In a group of 23 (or more) randomly chosen people, there is more than 50% probability that some pair of them will both have been born on the same day of the year. For 57 or more people, the probability is more than 99%, tending toward 100% as the pool of people grows. The problem is to calculate the probability of having no duplicate birthdays and the probability of having duplicate birthdays in a group of people. The number of days in a year is 365 and the number of people to check is 100.",
