  "description": "Langford's number problem (CSP lib problem 24) involves arranging 2 sets of positive integers 1..k into a sequence. The condition for the sequence is that, following the first occurrence of an integer i, each subsequent occurrence of i, appears i+1 indices later than the last. For example, for k=4, a solution would be 41312432. The problem also includes a constraint that k mod 4 = 0 or k mod 4 = 3. The goal is to find a sequence that satisfies these conditions. The solution is represented as an array where the numbers are in their proper positions.",
