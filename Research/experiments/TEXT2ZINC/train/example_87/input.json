  "description": "Workforce management problem for a Popsicle stand where the goal is to minimize the staffing cost while meeting the required staffing levels for each day of the recurrent period. (an example is a week). There are two types of workers, full time and part time workers. Full time workers and part time workers both work in shifts which are a specific number of consecutive days, followed by time-period - shift length days off. Part time and full time workers have different shift lengths, and different costs per day to hire them for.",
