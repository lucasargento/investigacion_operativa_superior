  "description": "The problem is a work-shift scheduling problem. There are six workers: Alan, Bob, John, Mike, Scott, and Ted. These workers are to be assigned to three working shifts. The first shift needs at least one and at most four people; the second shift needs at least two and at most three people; and the third shift needs exactly two people. Alan does not work on the first shift; Bob works only on the third shift. The others can work any shift. The objective is to find a feasible assignment for this problem. The variables W1\u2013W6 identify the shift to be assigned to each of the six workers: Alan, Bob, John, Mike, Scott, and Ted.",
