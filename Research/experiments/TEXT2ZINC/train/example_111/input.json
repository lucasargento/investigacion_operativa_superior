Find 9 distinct non-zero digits that satisfy:\n\n```\nA    D    G\n-- + -- + -- == 1\nBC   EF   HI\n```\n\nwhere `BC` is shorthand for `10B+C`, `EF` for `10E+F` and `HI` for `10H+I`.\n\n\n# n-Fractions\n\nA simple generalisation is as follows. Find 3n non-zero digits satisfying: $ 1 = \\sum_{i \\in 1..n} x_i / y_iz_i $\n\nwhere $y_iz_i$ is shorthand for $10y_i+z_i$ and the number of occurrences of each digit in $1..9$ is between $1$ and $ceil(n/3)$.\n\nSince each fraction is at least $1/99$, this family of problems has solutions for at most $n <= 99$.\nAn interesting problem would be to find the greatest $n$ such that at least one solution exists.\nA further generalisation might specify that the fractions sum to $ceil(n/3)$.",
