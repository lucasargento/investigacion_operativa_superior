  "description": "Bus driver scheduling is modeled as a set partitioning problem where a subset of shifts is selected to cover each piece of work exactly once. Each shift covers a subset of the whole set of works. The goal is to minimize the number of shifts used. The problem involves various bus companies with different shift requirements and features. The given data includes the number of works, shifts, minimum shifts required, and the details of shifts covering each work.",
