  "description": "A bakery wants to optimize its croissant production while minimizing total baking time. There are two types of croissants: almond and pistachio. Each type requires a certain amount of butter and flour, and the total available ingredients place a limit on how many can be made. Since almond croissants are more popular, their production must be at least a fixed multiple of the pistachio croissant production. Additionally, the time required to bake each type varies, so the goal is to determine the optimal number of each croissant to produce while using ingredients efficiently and keeping baking time as low as possible.",
