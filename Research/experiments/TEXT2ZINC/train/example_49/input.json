  "description": "A traveler starts in one city and needs to visit several cities for business. We are given the distances between each pair of cities in miles. These distances are symmetric which means the distance from city a to city b is the same as the distance from city b to city a. The traveler must return to the city they started in after visiting all the cities. Determine the shortest route that the traveler can take to visit all the cities and return to back to the starting city.",
