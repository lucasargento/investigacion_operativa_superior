  "description": "US soybean suppliers ship soybeans to different destinations using various routes. Consider a transportation network consisting of several cities. Soybeans are sent from a terminal city to a port city. Subsequently, Soybeans are transported from a port city to a destination city. We are given a set of routes between cities and a positive transport cost per metric ton to transport soybeans per ton along that route. Each source terminal has a soybean supply and each destination has a demand for soybeans that must be met. What quantity of soybeans should they transport along each route from source to destination to minimize transportation costs?",
