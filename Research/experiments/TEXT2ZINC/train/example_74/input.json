  "description": "Balanced Incomplete Block Design (BIBD) generation is a standard combinatorial problem from design theory, involving arranging distinct objects into blocks with specific constraints. The goal is to create blocks where each block contains a fixed number of objects, each object appears in a fixed number of blocks, and every pair of objects appears together in a fixed number of blocks. The problem is specified by parameters. We are provided with the number of objects, the number of blocks, the occurrences of each object in blocks, the distinct objects in each block, and the pairs which appear together.",
