  "description": "The problem is based on a puzzle called 'O.R. with the Fairies' from Martin J. Chlond. The puzzle involves fairies, children, colors, and nights. There are 5 fairies (Cloe, Ariana, Oliviana, Anya, Caroline), 3 children (Tyler, Jordan, David), 9 colors (silver, sage, gold, rose, turquoise, ivory, violet, emerald, earth), and a certain number of nights. Each child has a star of a certain color and each child receives a certain number of pearls each night. Each fairy visits the children on certain nights. The problem is to determine which color each fairy is attracted to, given the following constraints: the number of pearls received by each child on each night is consistent with the visits and the color of the stars, each fairy is attracted to a single color, at least one fairy is attracted to turquoise, and exactly one fairy is attracted to earth.",
