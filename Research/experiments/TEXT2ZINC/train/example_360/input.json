  "description": "The problem is about Strimko, a puzzle game. The game is played on an nxn grid. The objective is to fill the grid in such a way that each row and column of the grid must contain the numbers 1, 2, ..., n exactly once, forming a Latin square. Additionally, each 'stream' (connected path in the grid) must also contain the numbers 1, 2, ..., n exactly once. Some numbers are already placed in the grid, and these placements cannot be changed. The task is to find a valid completion of the grid that satisfies all these conditions.",
