  "description": "A small firm specializes in making some types of spare automobile parts. Each part has to go through several shops. There is a required number of worker-hours for each type of part in each shop. Making a type of part results in an amount of profit specific to the part. Each shop has a maximum capacity of working hours. How much of each spare part is to be made to maximize profit?",
