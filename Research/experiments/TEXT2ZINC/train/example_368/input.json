  "description": "This problem is based on the 'Tokyo Elevator Puzzle' by Martin Chlond. The puzzle involves an elevator in a building with 8 floors. The elevator makes 70 trips, and the data for each trip is represented in a 2D array. Each row in the array represents a trip, and each column represents a floor. A '1' in a cell indicates that the elevator stopped at that floor during the trip, while a '0' indicates that it did not. The goal of the puzzle is to find a pattern or strategy for the elevator's stops that minimizes the total time or distance traveled.",
