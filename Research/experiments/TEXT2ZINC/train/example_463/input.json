  "description": "The problem is about enforcing all variables of a collection to belong to distinct intervals. The intervals are defined by [SIZE_INTERVAL*k, SIZE_INTERVAL*k+SIZE_INTERVAL-1] where k is an integer. For example, if we have a collection of variables (2,3,10) and SIZE_INTERVAL=3, it defines the following family of intervals [3*k, 3*k+2], where k is an integer. Since the three variables of the collection take values that are respectively located within the three following distinct intervals [0, 2], [3, 5] and [9, 11], the alldifferent_interval constraint holds. The problem is to find such intervals for a given collection of variables and a SIZE_INTERVAL.",
