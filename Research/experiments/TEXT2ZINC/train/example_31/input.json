  "description": "Problem involves coordinating relief efforts after catastrophes by dropping relief packages in locations that minimize the total distance villagers must travel to pick them up. Villager locations are given on a grid, and only air drop options for relief supply delivery are available. Each villager will pick up supplies from the nearest drop location. We can choose exactly 2 airdrop locations and have to minimize the sum of squared distances of huts to their closest relief package destination.",
