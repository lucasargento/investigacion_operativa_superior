  "description": "The Non-dominating queens puzzle is a variation of the classic N-Queens problem. The problem is to place N queens on an NxN chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other and the number of squares that are attacked or occupied is minimized. A square is considered attacked if it is in the same row, column, or diagonal as a queen. The objective is to minimize the number of squares that are either occupied by a queen or are under attack by a queen. The problem is defined on a 5x5 chessboard in this case.",
