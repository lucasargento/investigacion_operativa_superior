  "description": "Consider a school district with several neighborhoods, schools, and grades at each school. Each school has a capacity for each grade. For each neighborhood, we are given the student population for each grade. Finally, we are given the distance of each school from each neighborhood. We want to assign all students to schools while minimizing the total distance traveled by all students. We may ignore the fact that numbers of students must be integers.",
