  "description": "The problem is about placing n checkers on an (n x n) checkers board with the following restrictions: \n1) In each column there is EXACTLY one checker. \n2) For i=1,2,...,(n-1), the first i rows cannot have EXACTLY i checkers. \nThe goal is to count the number of ways to do so. The hypothesis is that the answer is n^{n-1}, but it needs to be proven. If restriction 2) is removed, the answer is obviously n^n. The problem also involves finding the number of different row patterns for different values of n. The patterns seem to follow the Catalan numbers.",
