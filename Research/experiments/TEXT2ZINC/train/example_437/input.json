  "description": "The Aircraft Landing Problem (ALP) is the problem of deciding a landing time on an appropriate runway for each aircraft in a given set of TotalAircrafts aircraft such that each aircraft lands within a predetermined time window defined by an EarliestLandingTime and a LatestLandingTime; and separation criteria between the landing of an aircraft i, and the landing of all successive aircraft j, are respected, determined by SeparationTimeMatrix. Each aircraft has a TargetLandingTime, and penalties are incurred for landing after (PenaltyTimeAfterTarget) or before (PenaltyTimeBeforeTarget) this target time.",
