  "description": "The Abbott's Puzzle is a problem from the book 'Amusements in Mathematics' by H.E. Dudeney (1917). The problem is to find a solution for three variables x[1], x[2], and x[3] that satisfy the following conditions: \n1. The sum of each variable multiplied by its corresponding amount (6, 4, 1 respectively) equals 200. \n2. The sum of the variables equals 100. \n3. The second variable is five times the first variable. \nThe variables are integers and can take values between 0 and 1000.",
