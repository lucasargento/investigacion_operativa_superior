  "description": "Consider a rocket that travels along a straight path. We are given the position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively, of the rocket at each time. By discretizing time and by taking the time increment to be unity, we obtain an approximate discrete-time model of the form \n    \n    x_{t+1} = x_t + v_t\n    v_{t+1} = v_t + a_t\n\nWe assume that the acceleration a_t at each given timestep is under our control, as it is determined by the rocket thrust. In a rough model, the magnitude |a_t| of the accelera\u00adtion can be assumed to be proportional to the rate of fuel consumption at a given timestep t. \n\nSuppose that we have the initial position and velocity of the rocket. We wish the rocket to take off and reach a target position with a target speed at a target time. Furthermore, we wish to accomplish this economically, that is, by using as little fuel as possible. Given a target time T, what should the acceleration be at each timestep if we want to minimize the total fuel consumption given by \\sum_{t=0}^{\\var{T}-1} |\\var{a_t}| subject to the given constraints.",
