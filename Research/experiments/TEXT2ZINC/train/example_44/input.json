  "description": "A paper company produces large rolls of paper with a given width. These large rolls are cut into smaller rolls of various widths options to meet customer demand. There are several different types of smaller rolls characterized by their width. Each roll of a given width has a demand. The company has several different cutting patterns available for producing the smaller rolls. Each pattern results in some amount of rolls of each width. Determine the minimum number of large rolls needed to fulfill all the orders.",
