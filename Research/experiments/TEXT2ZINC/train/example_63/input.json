  "description": "A small firm specializes in making some types of spare automobile parts. Each part has to go through several shops. Each type of part had a requirement in worker-hours in each shop and results in an amount of profit. Each shop has a capacity of working hours it cannot exceed. Determine the quantities of each spare part to be made during the month to maximize profit.",
