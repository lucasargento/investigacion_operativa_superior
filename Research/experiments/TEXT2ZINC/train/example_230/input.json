  "description": "The company\u2019s declared objective is to minimize costs. It has K categories of requirements, with each category consisting of I different requirements. The strength of each requirement category is denoted by Strength, whereas the cost reductions per unit less waste in each category and the additional costs per unit more waste in each category are represented by LessOneWaste and MoreOneWaste, respectively. The number of recruits in each category is given by Recruit, and the cost of redundancy per recruit in each category is CostRedundancy. The company can allow NumOverman over-managed categories, with each over-managed category incurring a cost of CostOverman. Similarly, NumShortwork short-work categories are permissible, each one resulting in a cost of CostShort. How should they operate in order to minimize these costs?",
