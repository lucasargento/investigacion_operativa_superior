  "description": "The optimization problem is focused on efficiently allocating goods from a set of origins, denoted by OriginNum, to a set of destinations, represented by DestinationNum. Each originating point has a certain supply of goods, Supply_i, where i is an origin. Correspondingly, each destination point has a specific demand, Demand_j, where j is a destination. The cost associated with sending goods from origin i to destination j is represented by Cost_{i,j}. The objective is to minimize the total transportation cost while meeting the demands at the destinations without exceeding the supplies at the origins.",
