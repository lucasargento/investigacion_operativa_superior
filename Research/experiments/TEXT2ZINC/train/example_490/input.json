  "description": "The problem is about identifying the sequence and sum of N natural increasing numbers. The sequence is written in groups: 1; 2,3; 4,5,6; 7,8,9,10; ... and the task is to add the groups. This is also known as the 'sum of the next n natural numbers'. The sequence M(n) of magic constants for n X n magic squares (numbered 1 through n^2) from n=3 begins M(n) = 15, 34, 65, 111, 175, 260, .. The number of solutions (without the 'identify constraint') for n is n*n-n. The problem is to find an array of n natural numbers (x) and their sum (z) such that all numbers in x are different, x is in increasing order, the difference between the last and first number in x is n-1, and the sum z equals n*(n*n + 1) / 2. The problem is inspired by the 'farmer and cows' problem where n=9.",
