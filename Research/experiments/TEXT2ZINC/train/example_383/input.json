  "description": "The problem is about calculating the One Repetition Maximum (1RM) for weight training and age adjustment of weights. The 1RM is the maximum amount of weight that a person can possibly lift for one repetition of a given exercise. The model also calculates the equivalent weights for different numbers of repetitions. For example, it can calculate how much weight corresponds to a session of 6 repetitions of 87kg for a session of 12 repetitions. The model also calculates the age adjusted weights for different weights and 1RM. For a 60 year old man, this corresponds to weight x 1.514. The model uses Brzycki's formula for calculating 1RM given weight and reps. The solver must support decision variables of type var float. The model was created by Hakan Kjellerstrand.",
