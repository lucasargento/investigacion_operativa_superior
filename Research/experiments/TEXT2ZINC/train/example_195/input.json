  "description": "We want to assign all students to schools, while minimizing the total distance traveled by all students. We have a total number of S schools, G student groups, and N neighborhoods. Each school s has a capacity for student group g represented by Capacity. The population of student group g in neighborhood n is given by Population. The distance between neighborhood n and school s is denoted as Distance. We may ignore the fact that numbers of students must be integers.",
