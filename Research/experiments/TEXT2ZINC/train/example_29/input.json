  "description": "A coin plating operation involves two processes: process A and process B. Process A uses a fixed amount of gold and wires to plate a certain number of coins, while process B uses different amounts of gold and wires to plate a different number of coins. With limited resources of gold and wires, the objective is to determine how many times each process should be executed to maximize the total number of coins plated.",
