  "description": "As the manager of a Popsicle stand, you are required to hire and set the weekly work schedule for your employees. The required levels for the week are as follows: Monday = 5, Tuesday = 7, Wednesday = 7, Thursday = 10, Friday = 16, Saturday = 18, Sunday = 12. Assume the same staffing requirements continue week after week. Full-time employees work five consecutive days and earn $100 per day. Part-time employees work two consecutive days and earn $150 per day. The problem is to determine the minimal weekly staffing cost you can achieve while meeting the required staffing levels.",
