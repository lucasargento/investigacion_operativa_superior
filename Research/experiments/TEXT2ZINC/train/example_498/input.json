  "description": "The problem is about finding prime numbers in a given range. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The range is from 1 to a given number 'n'. The problem requires to find all the prime numbers in this range and also the total number of prime numbers found. A number 'x' is considered prime if it is greater than 1 and for all numbers 'i' from 2 to the square root of 'x', 'x' is not divisible by 'i'.",
