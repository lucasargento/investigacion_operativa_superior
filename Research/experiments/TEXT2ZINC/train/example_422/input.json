  "description": "Professor ABC sells his economics textbook as paperback or hardcover versions . Paperback books yield a profit of $ 150 USD whereas hardcover versions yield a profit of $ 200 USD . Since hardcover versions are more sturdy and contain some extra supplementary materials , there must be at least three times as many hardcover than paperback textbooks . However , because paperback books are less expensive , at least 100 paperback versions must be created . If the professor sells at least 1000 textbooks every year , how many of each version should he request the publisher to print to maximize the profit ?",
