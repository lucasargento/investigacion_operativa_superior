  "description": "A division of an auto parts manufacturer produces different parts using different machines. A batch of 100 parts requires a specific amount of hours on each machine. There is a cost per hour of operating each machine, and each machine has a limited availability in hours for each month. The division sells parts in batches of 100 at a price specific to each part. For each type of part, the first machine has a setup time in hours before it can be used on this type of part. Other machines do not require a setup time. There is no minimum production quantity for any part. How many batches of each part should the manufacturer produce each month to maximize profit?",
