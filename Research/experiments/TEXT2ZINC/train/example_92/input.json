  "description": "A manufacturer wishes to produce an amount in lb of an alloy that consists of several kinds of metals. We know that by weight, the alloy we want contains a target quantity of each type of metal. Several other kinds of alloys are available at various prices and these alloys can be melted together to get the alloy we want. We know the price at which each alloy is sold per unit and the ratio of each metal in the alloys. Find the cheapest combination of quantities of alloys that reaches the target quantity of each type of metal.",
