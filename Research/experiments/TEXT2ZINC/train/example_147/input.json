  "description": "---\nTitle:    Water Bucket Problem \nProposer: Toby Walsh\nCategory: \n    - Bin packing\n    - Partitioning and related problems\n---\n\n\nGiven the promise of SAT and CSP techniques for solving \"classical\" planning problems, I decided to propose this puzzle.\n\nYou are given an 8 pint bucket of water, and two empty buckets which can contain 5 and 3 pints respectively. You are required to divide the water into two by pouring water between buckets (that is, to end up with 4 pints in the 8 pint bucket, and 4 pints in the 5 pint bucket).\n\nWhat is the minimum number of transfers of water between buckets? The challenge is to solve this as a planning problem (encoded into satisfiability or constraint satisfaction) with an efficiency approaching (or exceeding) a simple [enumeration](models/enumerate.pl).",
