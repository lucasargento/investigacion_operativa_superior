  "description": "An economy consists of several industries. Each unit produced by one of the industries (a unit will be taken as \u00a31\u2019s worth of value of production) requires inputs from possibly its own industry as well as other industries. For each industry, we know how much input it requires from each of the industries (including itself) and the manpower it requires. There is a time lag in the economy so the output in year t+1 requires inputs from year t. Output from an industry may also be used to build productive capacity for itself or other industries in future years. To give unit increases (capacity for \u00a31\u2019s worth of extra production) in productive capacity of an industry, some units of industry from each industry and some units of manpower are needed. Input from an industry in year t results in a (permanent) increase in productive capacity in year t + 2. Additionally, stocks of goods may be held from year to year. We are given the stocks of each industry and the capacity of each industry at present (year 0). Additionally, there is a limited yearly manpower capacity that cannot be changed. Maximize total production in the last two years.",
