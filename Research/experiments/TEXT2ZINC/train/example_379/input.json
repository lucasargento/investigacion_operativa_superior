  "description": "This is a standard benchmark problem, known as Eq 10 in MiniZinc. The problem involves finding values for seven variables X1 to X7, each ranging from 0 to 10, that satisfy a set of ten equations. Each equation is a linear combination of the variables, with specific coefficients for each variable and a constant term. The goal is to find a solution that satisfies all the equations.",
