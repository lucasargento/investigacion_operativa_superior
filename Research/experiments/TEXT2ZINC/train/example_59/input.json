  "description": "A company produces different types of steel using different alloys. The company has a certain amount of each alloy available. Steel requires a certain percentage of carbon and has a maximum allowable percentage of nickel. Each alloy contains a percentage of carbon and a percentage of nickel. Each type of alloy also has a purchase price per ton. Each type of steel has a selling price per ton. Additionally, all steel must have at most 40% of alloy 1 in it. How much of each alloy should the company use in each type of steel, and how much of each steel type should be produced to maximize profit?",
