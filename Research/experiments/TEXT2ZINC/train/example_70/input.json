  "description": "A small computer manufacturing company forecasts the demand over the following months. These demands must be satisfied and can not be shorted. In any month it can produce a maximum number of units, using regular production, at a regular cost in dollars per unit. However, by using overtime, it can produce additional units at an overtime rate in dollars per unit. The firm can store units from month to month at a rate in dollars per unit per month. Find the production schedule that minimizes the cost.",
