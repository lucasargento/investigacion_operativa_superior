  "description": "---\nTitle: Killer Sudoku\nProposer: Peter Nightingale\nCategory: Games and puzzles\n---\n\nKiller Sudoku is a puzzle played on a $\\\\{9\\times 9\\\\}$ grid containing 81 cells. \nThe cells are filled in with numbers from the set $\\\\{1\\ldots 9\\\\}$.\nEach row and column must contain all numbers $\\\\{1\\ldots 9\\\\}$. Each of the 9\nnon-overlapping $3\\times 3$ subsquares (named *boxes*) must also contain all numbers $\\\\{1\\ldots 9\\\\}$.\n\nEach Killer Sudoku puzzle has a set of *cages*. A cage is a set of contiguous cells\nand a total; the numbers in the cells must add up to the total. Also, the cells in\na cage cannot contain the same number more than once. The cages do not overlap, \nand they cover all cells. Cages typically contain two to four cells. \nTypically a Killer Sudoku puzzle will have exactly one solution. \n\nAn example Killer Sudoku puzzle is shown below. Each cage is shown as an area of one colour.\n\n<center>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"assets/Killersudoku_color.svg\" alt=\"Killer Sudoku Puzzle\">\n  <figcaption>A Killer Sudoku Puzzle (public domain image from Wikipedia)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</center>\n\nThe solution of the above puzzle is shown below. \n\n<center>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"assets/Killersudoku_color_solution.svg\" alt=\"Killer Sudoku Puzzle Solution\">\n  <figcaption>A Killer Sudoku Puzzle Solution (public domain image from Wikipedia)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</center>\n\n\nGeneralisation to $n \\times n$ grids\n------\n\nThere is a straightforward generalisation of Killer Sudoku. For any $n$ that has\nan integer square root, we have an $n \\times n$ grid and each cell takes any\nvalue in $\\\\{1\\ldots n\\\\}$. In a solution each row and column contains all numbers $\\\\{1\\ldots n\\\\}$,\nand the $n$ non-overlapping $\\sqrt{n} \\times \\sqrt{n}$ boxes also contain all\nnumbers $\\\\{1\\ldots n\\\\}$. Cages function in the same way in the generalised \nproblem as in the $\\\\{9\\times 9\\\\}$ problem.",
