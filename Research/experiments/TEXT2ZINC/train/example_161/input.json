That is, for each of the intervals, there is a pair of neighbouring pitch-classes in the series, between which this interval appears. \n\nThe problem of finding such a series can be easily formulated as an instance of a more general arithmetic problem on $\\mathbb Z_n$, the set of integer residues modulo $n$. Given $n \\in \\mathbb N$, find a vector $s = (s_1, ..., s_n)$, such that \n\n 1. $s$ is a permutation of $\\mathbb Z_n = \\{0,1,...,n-1\\}$; and \n 2. the interval vector $v = (|s_2-s_1|, |s_3-s_2|, ... |s_n-s_{n-1}|)$ is a permutation of $ \\mathbb Z_n \\setminus \\\\{0\\\\} = \\\\{1,2,...,n-1\\\\}$. \n \nA vector $v$ satisfying these conditions is called an all-interval series of size $n$; the problem of finding such a series is the all-interval series problem of size $n$. We may also be interested in finding all possible series of a given size. \n\nThe All-Interval Series is a special case of the {prob053} in which the graph is a line.",
