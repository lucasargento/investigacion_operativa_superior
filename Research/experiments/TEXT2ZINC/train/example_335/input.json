  "description": "The problem is about finding the digital root of a number. The digital root (also repeated digital sum) of a number is the number obtained by adding all the digits, then adding the digits of that number, and then continuing until a single-digit number is reached. For example, the digital root of 65,536 is 7, because 6 + 5 + 5 + 3 + 6 = 25 and 2 + 5 = 7. The task is to find the digital root for a given number 'x' and also for a range of numbers from 1 to 'm'. The digital root is calculated using a base 10 number system.",
