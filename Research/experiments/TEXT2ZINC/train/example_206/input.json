  "description": "Determine the quantities to be produced such that all the production constraints are satisfied and the profit is maximized. The parameters include the number of different products K and the number of different machines or stations S. Each product k requires ProduceTime to produce on station s. Each station s has a total available time of AvailableTime. The profit from producing one unit of product k is Profit.",
