  "description": "A toy storage company needs to transport toys using a manual pallet jack or an electric pallet jack . The toy storage company has access to at most 6 manual pallet jacks and 15 electric pallet jacks . The manual pallet jacks can transport 15 boxes every hour while electric pallet jacks can transport 25 boxes every hour . Since electric jacks require less work , the number of electric pallet jacks must exceed the number of manual pallet jacks . If the company can use at most 8 manual pallet jacks and at least 5 electric pallet jacks , how many of each should the company use to maximize the number of boxes they can transport ?",
