  "description": "A foundry receives a specific order for several tons of steel. This steel must meet the following characteristics: it must contain at least a given percentage of manganese (Mn) while its percentage of silicon (SI) must be between a lower and upper limit. To cast this steel, the foundry has limited quantities of several types of minerals. For each of these minerals, we are given the percentage per mineral of the silicon and manganese content. Additionally, the addition of manganese directly is possible in the process of producing steel. The manganese is available at a fixed price per ton. We are also given the price per ton to purchase each of the minerals. The foundry plans to sell the steel produced at a fixed price per ton. The cost of smelting a ton of mineral is given and is independent of the mineral. How should the manufacturer manage the steel to maximize profit?",
