  "description": "This is a nonlinear optimization problem. The problem is to find the values of L, w, and h that maximize the product of w and h (wh), subject to the following constraints: L, w, and h are all non-negative integers; wh is at least 625; the sum of twice w and twice h equals L; L is at most 100; and h is at least 2. The optimal solution, according to Taha's 'Operations Research', is when w equals h equals L/4.",
