  "description": "Custom Tees is planning an online advertising campaign with different ad types across two web companies. The company has set a goal of in the number of clicks from visitors aged 18-25 and another for visitors older than 25. Additionally, there is a unique click goal for visitors from these two age categories as well. For each ad, there is an estimated percentage of clicks from the 18-25 range and an estimated percentage of clicks from the older visitors. Each ad also incurs a cost per 1000 clicks and has a maximum allowable number of clicks. Each ad also has an estimated percentage of unique visitors that is assumed to be the same across all age categories. If the company has a given advertising budget, how many clicks from each ad type should Custom Tees purchase to maximize the number of unique clicks within the budget?",
