  "description": "The Aircraft Landing Problem involves determining optimal landing times for a set of aircraft while minimizing penalties associated with deviations from target landing times. Each aircraft must land within a given time window and maintain a required separation time from other aircraft. Landing too early or too late incurs a penalty proportional to the time difference. The objective is to minimize the total penalty while ensuring all constraints are met.",
