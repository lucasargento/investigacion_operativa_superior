  "description": "This problem is a model of kidney exchange, inspired by Pascal Van Hentenryck's introduction of the Coursera Course Discrete Optimization. The objective is to maximize the number of exchanges. The problem involves a number of people who are compatible to give or receive a kidney. The compatibility is represented as a directed graph where each person is a node and an edge from person A to person B indicates that person A can give a kidney to person B. The problem is to find an assignment of kidneys such that each person either gives a kidney and receives one or does neither, and the total number of exchanges is maximized. Note that we are looking for cycles, or at least that anyone that gives a kidney also receives a kidney.",
