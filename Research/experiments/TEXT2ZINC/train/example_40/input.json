  "description": "A fine foods company produces gift baskets for a season that lasts a certain number of weeks. Each week has a demand that must be met. There are two types of labor available, regular and overtime. Both types of labor have a limit on the number of hours per week and have a cost associated with them per hour. Each basket takes the same amount of time to assemble and has a material cost and selling price. Unsold baskets from a week have a holding cost per week. At the end of the season, unsold baskets have a salvage value. (they do not incur a holding cost). If no baskets are available at the start of week 1, how much regular and overtime labor should be utilized each week to assemble the baskets to maximize the profit over the season?",
