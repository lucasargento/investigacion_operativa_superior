  "description": "The problem is about two circles. The sum of their circumferences is equal to 10322*Pi and the sum of their areas is equal to 13946281*Pi. The task is to find the radius of each circle. The area of a circle is calculated as Pi*r^2 and the circumference as 2*Pi*r. The radius of each circle is a real number between 0 and 10000. The radius of the first circle should be less than or equal to the radius of the second circle.",
