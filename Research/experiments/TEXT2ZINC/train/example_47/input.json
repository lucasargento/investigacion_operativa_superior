  "description": "A number of power stations are committed to meeting the following electricity load demands over a day. Each period of a day has a given demand that must be met. There are several types of generating units available, and each type has its own availability. Each type of generator also has a minimum production level and a maximum production level. There is an hourly cost of running a generator at minimum level and an extra hourly cost for each megawatt at which a generator is operated above the minimum level. These costs are specific to the type of generator. Additionally, starting up a type of generator also involves a cost specific to the type of generator. Which generators should be working in which periods of the day to minimize total cost?",
