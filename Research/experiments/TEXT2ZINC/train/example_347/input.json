  "description": "The Hidato puzzle is a logic puzzle game where a grid of cells is given, some of which are filled with numbers. The goal is to fill the remaining cells with consecutive numbers that will form a path from the start number to the end number, where the path is a sequence of horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent cells. The start and end numbers are circled. The size of the grid is r x c, where r is the number of rows and c is the number of columns. The puzzle is represented as a 2D array, where 0 represents an empty cell and a positive integer represents a filled cell.",
