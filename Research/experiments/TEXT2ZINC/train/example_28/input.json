  "description": "A company produces liquid and foam hand sanitizers using limited water and alcohol resources. Each type of sanitizer requires a different amount of ingredients and cleans a different number of hands. The company must ensure that more foam sanitizers are produced than liquid sanitizers, while also limiting the number of liquid sanitizers produced. The objective is to maximize the number of hands that can be cleaned.",
