  "description": "The Bridge and Torch problem, also known as The Midnight Train and Dangerous crossing, is a logic puzzle that deals with 4 people, a bridge and a torch. It is one of the category of river crossing puzzles, where a number of objects must move across a river, with some constraints. Four people come to a river in the night. There is a narrow bridge, but it can only hold two people at a time. Because it's night, the torch has to be used when crossing the bridge. Person A can cross the bridge in 1 minute, B in 2 minutes, C in 5 minutes, and D in 8 minutes. When two people cross the bridge together, they must move at the slower person's pace. The question is, can they all get across the bridge in 15 minutes or less?",
