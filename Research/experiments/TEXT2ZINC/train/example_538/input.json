  "description": "The problem is about assigning five programmers to five programming jobs. Each programmer has a preference for each job, ranked from 1 (most preferred) to 5 (least preferred). The goal is to maximize the total preference of the group by minimizing the sum of the preferences. The preference matrix is as follows:\n\nPROGRAMMER     JOB1 JOB2 JOB3 JOB4 JOB5\nPROGRAMMER1    4    1    3    5    2\nPROGRAMMER2    2    1    3    4    5\nPROGRAMMER3    3    2    4    1    5\nPROGRAMMER4    2    3    4    5    1\nPROGRAMMER5    4    2    3    1    5\n\nThe solution should assign each programmer to a job in such a way that the total sum of preferences is minimized. The solution should also ensure that each job is assigned to exactly one programmer and each programmer is assigned exactly one job.",
