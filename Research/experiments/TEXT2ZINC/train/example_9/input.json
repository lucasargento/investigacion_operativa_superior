  "description": "The Aircraft Assignment Problem aims to assign aircraft to routes in order to minimize the total cost while satisfying demand constraints with available aircraft. The problem involves a set of aircraft and a set of routes. Given the costs of assigning an aircraft to a route, the objective is to minimize the total cost of the assignment. Each aircraft has limited availability and cannot be assigned to more routes than allowed. Each route has a specific demand that must be met, and aircraft have varying capacities that define how many passengers they can carry on a given route. The problem seeks to determine the most cost-effective assignment of aircraft to routes while ensuring all demand constraints are satisfied.",
