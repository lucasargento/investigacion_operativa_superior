  "description": "This is a multi-commodity transportation problem. Given a set of origins OriginNum, a set of destinations DestinationNum, and a set of products ProductNum. Each origin i has a certain supply of each product p, Supply_{i,p}, and each destination j has a certain demand for each product p, Demand_{j,p}. The cost of shipping one unit of product p from origin i to destination j is Cost_{i, j, p}. The problem aims to minimize the total cost of shipping all products from the origins to the destinations. It is constrained that the total amount of each product p shipped from each origin i equals its supply, the total amount of each product p shipped to each destination j equals its demand, and the total amount of all products shipped from each origin i to each destination j does not exceed a certain limit Limit_{i,j}. The decision variable is the number of units of each product p to be shipped from each origin i to each destination j.",
