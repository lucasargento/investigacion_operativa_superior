  "description": "An investor has a portfolio of various stocks. He starts with some shares of each stock that he bought at existing prices. The investor knows the current price of each share and the expected price that each share will go to after one year. If he sells shares, the investor pays transaction costs, which are a percentage of the amount transacted. In addition, the investor pays taxes, as a percentage of earnings, on capital gains (i.e., the difference between the amount received from selling shares and the amount paid to buy them). The investor wants to raise an amount of money net of capital gains and transaction costs. You can assume that the investor can sell floating point numbers of shares. How many shares does the investor need to sell to raise the needed money, net of capital gains and transaction costs, while maximizing the expected value of his portfolio next year?",
