  "description": "There are two ways to extract a metal from mined ores . The first way is to use process J and the second is process P. Process J can extract 5 units of metal using 8 units of water and produces 3 units of pollution . Process P can extract 9 units of metal using 6 units of water and produces 5 units of pollution . There can be at most 1500 units of water 1350 units of pollution . How many of each type of processes should be performed to maximize the amount of metal extracted ?",
