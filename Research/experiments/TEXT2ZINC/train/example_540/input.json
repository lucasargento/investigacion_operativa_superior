  "description": "The problem involves four students: Algy, Bertie, Charlie and Digby, who share a flat. Four newspapers are delivered to the house: the Financial Times, the Guardian, the Daily Express and the Sun. Each of the students reads all of the newspapers, in a particular order and for a specified amount of time. Algy gets up at 8:30, Bertie and Charlie at 8:45 and Digby at 9:30. The task is to determine the earliest time that they can all set off for college, given their reading schedules. The reading order for Algy is: FT, Guardian, Express, Sun. For Bertie, it's: Guardian, Express, FT, Sun. For Charlie, it's: Express, Guardian, FT, Sun. And for Digby, it's: Sun, FT, Guardian, Express. The goal is to minimize the latest end time of reading the newspapers.",
