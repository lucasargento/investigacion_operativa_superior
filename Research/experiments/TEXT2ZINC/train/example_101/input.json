  "description": "Consider the problem of operating a warehouse, by buying and selling the stock of a certain commodity, in order to maximize profit over a certain length of time, say several periods. The warehouse has a fixed capacity, and there is a cost per unit for holding stock for one period. The selling price, per unit of stock, of the commodity is known to fluctuate over a number of time periods. In any period there is a fixed price holding for purchase per unit of stock. Additionally, the warehouse is originally empty and is required to be empty at the end of the last period. Determine the amount of buying and selling in each period to maximize the profit over the months.",
