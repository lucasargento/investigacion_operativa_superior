  "description": "The problem is about finding an order m quasigroup, which is an mxm multiplication table of integers 1..m, where each element occurs exactly once in each row and column and certain multiplication axioms hold. In this case, the axiom 6 should hold, which is defined as (a*b)*b = a*(a*b). The constraints of the problem are: all rows and columns of the quasigroup must be different, the quasigroup must satisfy the multiplication axiom 6, the quasigroup must be idempotent (i.e., a*a = a for all a), and there are some symmetry-breaking constraints. The goal is to find a quasigroup that satisfies all these constraints.",
