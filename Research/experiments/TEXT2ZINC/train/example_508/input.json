  "description": "The problem is about symmetry breaking in MiniZinc. The task is to find seven integers A, B, C, D, E, F, G in the range of 1 to 50 that satisfy the following conditions: The sum of the cubes of A, B, C, and D is equal to the sum of the cubes of E, F, and G. Additionally, the integers must satisfy the following symmetry conditions: A is less than or equal to B, B is less than or equal to C, C is less than or equal to D, E is less than or equal to F, F is less than or equal to G, and A is less than or equal to E.",
