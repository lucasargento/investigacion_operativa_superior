  "description": "# Problem Dubois\n\nThis problem has been conceived by Olivier Dubois, and submitted to the second DIMACS Implementation Challenge.\nDubois's generator produces contradictory 3-SAT instances that seem very difficult to be solved by any general method.\nGiven an integer n, called the degree, Dubois's process allows us to construct a 3-SAT contradictory instance with 3 * n variables and 2 * n clauses,\neach of them having 3 literals.\n\n## Data\n  A number n, each clause of the problem has 3*n variables and 2*n clauses.\n\n## Model\n  a model can be found in this jupyter notebook [GitHub page](https://github.com/xcsp3team/pycsp3/blob/master/problems/csp/academic/Dubois.py).\n\n  constraints: [Table](http://pycsp.org/documentation/constraints/Table)\n\n## Execution\n```\n  python Dubois.py -data=number\n```\n\n## Tags\n  academic",
