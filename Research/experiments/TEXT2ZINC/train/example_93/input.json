  "description": "The problem is about finding the greatest combination of numbers in a square grid of numbers. The goal is to start at the top of the grid and move down row by row, selecting one number from each row. The selected number from each row forms a combination. The movement from one row to the next can be either straight down, down to the right, or down to the left. The problem is to find the combination that gives the maximum sum. For example, given the grid [[0,2,1,0], [0,1,1,0], [0,10,20,30]], the best move would be indices [1,2,3] for 33 points. Another example is the grid [0,1,1] [0,2,1] [10,0,0], one of the best paths is [1,1,0] for 13 points. The problem is to find the combination that gives the maximum sum and the path that leads to this sum.",
