  "description": "The problem is a movie scheduling problem. Given a list of movies with their respective start and end times, the goal is to schedule as many non-overlapping movies as possible. The movies and their respective time intervals are as follows: 'Tarjan of the Jungle' from 4 to 13, 'The Four Volume Problem' from 17 to 27, 'The President's Algorist' from 1 to 10, 'Steiner's Tree' from 12 to 18, 'Process Terminated' from 23 to 30, 'Halting State' from 9 to 16, 'Programming Challenges' from 19 to 25, ''Discrete' Mathematics' from 2 to 7, and 'Calculated Bets' from 26 to 31. The objective is to maximize the number of movies scheduled without any two movies overlapping in time.",
