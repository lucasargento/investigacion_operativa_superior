  "description": "A company is dealing with I different items over a planning horizon of M months. The buy price of item i in month m is given by BuyPrice. All items can be sold after refining for the same SellPrice. Each item is either a vegetable or not, which is indicated by IsVegetable. There is a limited refining capability where at most MaxVegetableRefiningPerMonth of vegetables and MaxNonVegetableRefiningPerMonth of non-vegetables can be refined in any given month. The company has a storage size of StorageSize and incurs a StorageCost for storing items per month. The refined products must fall within a hardness range of MinHardness to MaxHardness, where the hardness of item i is Hardness. Initially, the storage contains an amount of InitialAmount of items. What buying, storing, and manufacturing policy should the company pursue in order to maximize profit?",
