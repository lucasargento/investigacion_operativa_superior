  "description": "The Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) involves the distribution of goods between depots and customers using VehicleCount vehicles. Each vehicle has to supply CustomerCount customers, and has a limited capacity, VehicleCapacity_i, for each vehicle i. Each customer, j, has an associated demand, CustomerDemand_j, that must be satisfied within the customer-specific time window, defined by the lower and upper bounds, CustomerLBTW_j and CustomerUBTW_j, respectively. The CustomerDistance_{i,j} parameter represents the distance between customer i to customer j, and CustomerServiceTime_j denotes the service time for customer j.",
