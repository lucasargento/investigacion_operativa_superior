  "description": "The problem is about generating random problem instances in MiniZinc. The problem is inspired by the Park\u2013Miller random number generator, which is a simple random number generator (RNG) defined by the recurrence relation x[i+1] = g * x[i] mod n. The problem requires to generate an array of pseudo random elements with a given seed and maximum value. If the maximum value is 0, then no modulo operation is performed. The problem also includes a test constraint that for all i in 1 to n-1, x[i] should be greater than or equal to 0 and the sum of x[i] and x[i+1] should be equal to the sum of the corresponding elements in the random array.",
