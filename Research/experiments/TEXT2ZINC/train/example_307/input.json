  "description": "The problem is a coin puzzle, inspired by the XPress Mosel model created by Martin Chlond. The puzzle involves three types of coins with values 15, 16, and 17. The goal is to find the minimum number of coins needed to sum up to a required value of 121 (i.e., 11 * 11). Each type of coin can be used any number of times, including not at all. The solution to the problem is the number of each type of coin used to reach the required sum.",
