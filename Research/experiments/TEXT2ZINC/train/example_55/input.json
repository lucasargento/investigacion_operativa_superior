  "description": "The Hidato puzzle is a logic puzzle game where a grid of cells is given, some of which are filled with numbers. The goal is to fill the remaining cells with consecutive numbers that will form a path from the start number to the end number, where the path is a sequence of horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent cells. The start and end numbers are circled.",
