  "description": "A company must deliver a target number of units of its product at the end of each month. Material produced during a month can be delivered either at the end of the same month or can be stored as inventory and delivered at the end of a subsequent month. There is a storage cost per month for each unit of product held in inventory. The year begins with zero inventory. If the company produces x_i units in month i and x_{i+1} units in month i+1, it incurs a cost switch_cost |x_{i+1} - x_i| dollars, where switch_cost is a constant of proportionality, reflecting the cost of switching to a new production level. Assume that inventory left at the end of the year has no value and does not incur any storage cost. How much product should the company produce each month if it wants to minimize the total cost of the production and inventory schedule over the next few months?",
