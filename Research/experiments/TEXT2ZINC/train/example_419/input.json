  "description": "A chemical company is transporting their hydrogen using two different methods , high pressure tube trailers and liquefied hydrogen tankers . The first method is a high - pressure tube trailer which can transport 50 cubic meters each per trip at a cost of $ 500 . The second method is using liquefied hydrogen tankers which can transport 30 cubic meters each per trip at a cost of $ 200 . The company needs to transport at least 1000 cubic meters of hydrogen and they have budget of $ 3750 available . In addition , the number of transports done by the high pressure tube trailer method has to be less than the number of transports done by the liquefied hydrogen tanker method . How many of each transportation method should they use to minimize the total number of trips ?",
