  "description": "Given a set of numbers, the problem is to partition the set into two subsets such that the sum of the numbers in each subset is equal. For example, given the set {3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1,5,2,7}, it can be partitioned into two subsets {3,2,7} and {1,1,2,1,5,2} where the sum of each subset is 12. The problem requires determining if such a partition is possible and if so, finding the partition. The problem is solved using a constraint satisfaction approach where each number in the set is assigned to one of the two subsets such that the sum of the numbers in each subset is equal.",
