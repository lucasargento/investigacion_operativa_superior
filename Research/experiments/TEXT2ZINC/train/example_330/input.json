  "description": "This problem is known as Dudeney's bishop placement problem II. The problem is to place bishops on an 8x8 chessboard in such a way that every square is either occupied by a bishop or attacked by a bishop. The objective is to maximize the number of bishops placed on the board. A square is considered attacked if it is on the diagonal of a bishop. The problem is represented by two 8x8 matrices, 'x' and 'a'. 'x(i,j)' is 1 if square (i,j) is occupied by a bishop, and 0 otherwise. 'a(i,j)' is 1 if square (i,j) is attacked by a bishop, and 0 otherwise. The sum of all elements in 'x' gives the total number of bishops placed on the board. The constraints ensure that every square is either occupied or attacked, and that a square is considered attacked if it is on the diagonal of a bishop.",
