  "description": "A small electric utility operates various power plants to supply electricity to certain cities. Each power plant has a capacity. Each city has a peak demand which must be met at the same time. There is a transmission cost to send electricity from each power plant to each city. How much electricity should each power plant send to each city to minimize the total transmission cost?",
