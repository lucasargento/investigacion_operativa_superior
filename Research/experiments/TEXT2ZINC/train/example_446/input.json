  "description": "Consider a diet problem. Given a set of nutrients NutrientCount and a set of foods FoodCount. Each food j has a cost Cost_j and a range of amount that can be bought [FoodMin_j, FoodMax_j]. Each nutrient i has a range of amount that should be included in the diet [NutrientMin_i, NutrientMax_i]. The amount of nutrient i in food j is AmountNutrient_{i, j}. The problem aims to minimize the total cost of buying foods. It is constrained that the total amount of each nutrient i in the bought foods should be within its range. How to decide the amount of each food j to buy?",
