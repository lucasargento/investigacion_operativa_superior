  "description": "# Problem AllInterval\n\nGiven the twelve standard pitch-classes (c, c#, d, ...), represented by numbers 0,1,...,11,\nfind a series in which each pitch-class occurs exactly once and in which the musical intervals\nbetween neighboring notes cover the full set of intervals from the minor second (1 semitone) to the major seventh (11 semitones).\nThat is, for each of the intervals, there is a pair of neighboring pitch-classes in the series, between which this interval appears.\nElliott Carter often bases his all-interval sets on the list generated by Bauer-Mendelberg and Ferentz and uses them as a \"tonic\" sonority.\n\n![Carter All-Interval](https://pycsp.org/assets/notebooks/figures/Carter_all-interval_sets.png)\n\nThe problem of finding such a series can be easily formulated as an instance of a more general arithmetic problem.\nGiven a positive integer n, find a sequence x of n numbers such that:\n  - x is a permutation of {0,1,...,n-1};\n  - the interval sequence y = <|x1-x0|, |x2-x1|, ...>  is a permutation of {1,2,...,n-1}.\nA sequence satisfying these conditions is called an all-interval series of order n;\nthe problem of finding such a series is the all-interval series problem of order n.\n\n### Example\n  For n=8, a solution is:\n  ```\n    1 7 0 5 4 2 6 3\n  ```\n\n## Data\n  a number n, the size of the sequence\n\n## Model\n  There are two variants:\n  - a main variant;\n  - a variant 'aux' involving auxiliary variables.\n\n  You can also find a step-by-step modeling process in this [Jupyter notebook](http://pycsp.org/documentation/models/CSP/AllInterval/).\n\n  constraints: [AllDifferent](http://pycsp.org/documentation/constraints/AllDifferent)\n\n## Execution\n  - python AllInterval.py -data=number [-solve]\n  - python AllInterval.py -data=number -variant=aux [-solve]\n\n## Tags\n  academic, notebook",
