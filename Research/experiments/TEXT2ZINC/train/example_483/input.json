  "description": "The problem is to define the concept of antisymmetric in the context of a relation. An antisymmetric relation is one where no element is related to itself (no one is richer than him-/herself) and if one element is related to another, the second is not related to the first (if i is richer than j then j is not richer than i). The problem is modeled as a 4x4 matrix where each cell represents a binary relation between two elements. The goal is to find a configuration of this matrix that satisfies the antisymmetric property. Two versions of the antisymmetric property are defined, one directly from the definition and another as an alternative version.",
