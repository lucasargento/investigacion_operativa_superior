  "description": "The problem is about enforcing a lexicographical order on a matrix of domain variables. The matrix is defined such that both adjacent rows and adjacent columns are lexicographically ordered. This means that each row and each column must be in a non-decreasing order. For example, given a matrix with two rows and three columns, the first row <2, 2, 3> is lexicographically less than or equal to the second row <2, 3, 1>, the first column <2, 2> is lexicographically less than or equal to the second column <2, 3>, and the second column <2, 3> is lexicographically less than or equal to the third column <3, 1>. The problem is to find a matrix that satisfies these conditions.",
