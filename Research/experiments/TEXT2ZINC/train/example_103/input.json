  "description": "The knapsack problem has a significant place in the study of integer programming models with binary variables. In the knapsack problem, one needs to pack a set of items in a container. Each item has a value and a size. The container has a maximum capacity and if the total size of the items exceeds the capacity we can't pack them all. In this case, we need to choose a subset of the items of maximum total value that will fit in the container.\n",
