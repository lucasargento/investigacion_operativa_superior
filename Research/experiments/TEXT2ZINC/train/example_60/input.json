  "description": "The problem involves selecting the optimal store for each part to minimize the total cost of buying all parts including delivery costs. Each part has different prices in different stores, and each store has a delivery cost. If multiple products are purchased from a store then the delivery cost remains the same. The objective is to find the optimal assignment of parts to stores to minimize the total cost.",
