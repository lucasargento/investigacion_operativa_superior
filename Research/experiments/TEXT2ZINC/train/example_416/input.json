  "description": "A researcher is transporting their arsenal of imaging systems using two different methods , by delivery truck and by van . Transporting by delivery truck takes 12 hours and costs $ 300 per trip . Transporting by van takes 10 hours and costs $ 200 per trip . The researcher needs to transport 20 trips worth of equipment and has a budget of $ 5500 . Additionally , the number of transports by the delivery truck must be less than the number of transports by van . How many of each transportation method should they use to minimize the total number of hours spent on delivery ?",
