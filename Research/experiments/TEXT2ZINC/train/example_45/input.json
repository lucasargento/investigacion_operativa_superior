  "description": "A division of an auto parts manufacturer produces different parts using different machines. A batch of 100 parts requires a specific amount of hours on each machine. There is a cost per hour of operating each machine, and each machine has a limited availability in hours for each month. The division sells parts in batches of 100 at a price specific to each part. Further, for each part, the division has to produce a minimum number of batches per part to fulfill a contract. The first machine is being outsourced so that the manufacturer must pay for the labor. The labor has a standard cost per hour up to a limit after which it has an overtime rate per hour. Individual availability conditions for the 1st machine can be disregarded. The desired profit should surpass a given amount. Determine the quantity of batches for each part the manufacturer should produce every month, ensuring all constraints are met.",
