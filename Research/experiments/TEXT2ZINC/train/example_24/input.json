  "description": "Detect arbitrage loops in currency exchange markets where profitable trading sequences can be identified based on exchange rates between currencies. We're given the exchange rate between different currencies and the number of currencies in the arbitrage loop. An arbitrage loop is a sequence of currencies that can be traded into from the starting currency that when we end the loop and exchange into the final currency again, we return with more than what we started with. The goal is to maximize the total profit generated by following a specific sequence of currency exchanges.",
