There is a TimeRequired matrix detailing the time required to produce one batch of each part on each machine. Each machine has an associated cost given by MachineCosts and a monthly availability given by Availability. Each part can be sold for Prices and there is a minimum production requirement for each part detailed by MinBatches.",
