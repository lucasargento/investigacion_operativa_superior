  "description": "The Employee Assignment Problem is a scheduling problem where the goal is to assign NumEmployees employees to NumShifts shifts in NumRestaurants different restaurants based on their skills and preferences. Each employee has a set of skills out of NumSkills possible skills, and each restaurant has a demand for skilled employees during each shift. The objective is to minimize the cost of the schedule, which includes the cost of unfulfilled positions (each weighted by UnfulfilledPositionWeight) and the cost of assigning employees to less preferred positions (indicated by their preference levels for each skill).",
