  "description": "The problem is a number placement puzzle, where the goal is to place the numbers 1 through N inside a cross-shaped grid such that no two adjacent cells in any direction (up, down, left or right, or diagonal) contain adjacent numbers (+ or - 1). The shape of the cross and the adjacency of the cells are predefined. \n\nThe cross problem states that you can place the numbers 1 through N inside the cross such \nthat no two adjacent cells in any direction (up, down, left or right, or diagonal) contain \nadjacent numbers (+ or - 1).\n\nGiven the shape of an 8 sized cross below where the numbers represent the cell index:\n\n  1 4\n0 2 5 7\n  3 6\n\nthere are only 4 solutions for an 8 sized cross. In the above structure, cell 2 is adjacent to cells 0, 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 while cell 1 is adjacent to cell 0, 2, 4 and 5. Here is one of the 4 solutions:\n\n  5 3\n2 8 1 7\n  6 4\n\nHow many solutions are there on a 12 sized cross given the indexes below?\n\n  2 6\n0 3 7 10\n1 4 8 11\n  5 9\n\nFor example, in an 8 sized cross, cell 2 is adjacent to cells 0, 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 while cell 1 is adjacent to cell 0, 2, 4 and 5. The problem is to find all possible solutions for a given cross size and adjacency configuration.",
