  "description": "This problem is known as Wilkinson's problem, a non-linear problem. The problem is to find a value for 'x' in the range of -100.00 to 10.00 that minimizes 'x' and satisfies the constraint that 0.0 equals the product of (x+n) for n from 1 to 20 plus 0.00000011920928955078 times x to the power of 19. The solution to this problem is a real number that is approximately -20.84690810148.",
