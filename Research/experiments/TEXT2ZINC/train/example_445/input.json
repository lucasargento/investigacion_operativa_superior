  "description": "Consider a production problem. Given a set of products NumProducts and a set of stages NumStages. Each product p has a certain production rate ProductionRate_{p,s} in each stage s and a certain profit ProfitPerTon_p per ton. Each stage s has a certain number of hours StageAvailability_s available per week. There are also lower and upper limits on the tons of each product sold in a week, MinCommitment_p and MaxMarketLimit_p respectively. The problem aims to maximize the total profit from all products. It is constrained that the total number of hours used by all products in each stage s may not exceed the hours available. How to decide the number of tons to be produced for each product p?",
