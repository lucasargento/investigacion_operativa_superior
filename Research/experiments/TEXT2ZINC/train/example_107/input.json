  "description": "A division of an auto parts manufacturer produces different parts using different machines. A batch of 100 parts requires a specific amount of hours on each machine. There is a cost per hour of operating each machine, and each machine has a limited availability in hours for each month. The division sells parts in batches of 100 at a price specific to each part. Further, for each part, the division has to produce a minimum number of batches per part to fulfill a contract. Additionally for each machine, extra available time can be acquired at a rate per hour. There is also a limit on how many hours can be purchased for each machine. How many batches of each part should the manufacturer produce each month to maximize profit?",
