  "description": "Consider a directed graph G described by a collection of nodes. The task is to select a subset of arcs of G such that the corresponding graph is symmetric. This means that if there is an arc from node i to node j, there must also be an arc from node j to i. For example, consider the following nodes and their successors: \n\nindex-1 succ-{1,2,3},\nindex-2 succ-{1,3},\nindex-3 succ-{1,2},\nindex-4 succ-{5,6},\nindex-5 succ-{4},\nindex-6 succ-{4}\n\nThe symmetric constraint holds since the nodes collection depicts a symmetric graph. The problem is to find such a symmetric subset of arcs for a given directed graph.",
