  "description": "The problem is about constructing the timetable of a conference. The conference will consist of 11 sessions of equal length. The timetable is to be organized as a sequence of slots, where a slot can take up to 3 parallel sessions. There are the following constraints on the timing of the sessions: Session 4 must take place before Session 11. Session 5 must take place before Session 10. Session 6 must take place before Session 11. Session 1 must not be in parallel with Sessions 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, and 10. Session 2 must not be in parallel with Sessions 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, and 11. Session 3 must not be in parallel with Sessions 5, 6, and 8. Session 4 must not be in parallel with Sessions 6, 8, and 10. Session 6 must not be in parallel with Sessions 7 and 10. Session 7 must not be in parallel with Sessions 8 and 9. Session 8 must not be in parallel with Session 10. The goal is to minimize the number of slots.",
