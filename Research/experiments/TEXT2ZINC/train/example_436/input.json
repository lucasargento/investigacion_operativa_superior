  "description": "This is a transportation problem where there are multiple origins NumberOfOrigins and destinations NumberOfDestinations. Each origin has a certain supply SupplyOfOrigin, and each destination has a certain demand DemandOfDestination. The goal is to minimize the total cost of transportation TransportationCost. The cost of transporting from an origin i to a destination j is given by CostPerUnit_{i,j}. The problem is subject to the constraints that the total supply from each origin and the total demand at each destination must be met.",
