  "description": "The problem is to find distinct integers A, B, C, D, E, F in the range 2 to a given maximum value such that the sum of the fractions A/B, C/D, and E/F is equal to the product of the same fractions. Additionally, the fractions must be in increasing order, i.e., A/B < C/D < E/F. The problem is to find all such combinations of A, B, C, D, E, F that satisfy these conditions.",
