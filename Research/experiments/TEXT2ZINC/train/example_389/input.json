  "description": "The problem is to solve the Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation using Leibman's five-point finite-difference approximation. The problem is defined on a grid of size r x c, where r and c are integers. Each cell in the grid has a value between Z and M, where Z and M are floating point numbers. The value of a cell is determined by the average of its four neighboring cells (top, bottom, left, and right). The problem is to find the values of all cells in the grid that satisfy this condition. The problem is solved as a mixed integer programming (MIP) problem. The objective is to minimize the value of the cell at position (1,1).",
