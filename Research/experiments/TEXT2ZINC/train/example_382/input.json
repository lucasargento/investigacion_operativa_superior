  "description": "The problem is about converting temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit scales. The problem is modeled as a constraint satisfaction problem where the goal is to find a temperature that is the same in both Celsius and Fahrenheit scales. The temperature is represented as a floating point number and an integer in both scales. The conversion between the scales is done using the standard formula: C = (F - 32.0) * 5.0 / 9.0. The problem is solved by searching for a solution that satisfies all the constraints. The constraints ensure that the temperatures in both scales are the same and that they are integers. The problem is solved using a floating point search strategy with a precision of 0.01. The solution is the temperatures in both scales.",
