  "description": "An arcade is implementing two systems , a card - based system and a coin - based system . A card - based system can accept 60 guests per hour . Conversely , a coin - based system can only accept 45 guests per hour . The card - based machine needs 6 units of electricity every hour while the coin - based machine needs only 4 units of electricity every hour . The arcade needs to be able to accept at least 1500 guests per hour but only has access to 145 units of electricity every hour . Since most guests prefer to use cards , there must be more card - based than coin - based machines . How many of each machine should be kept in the arcade to minimize the total number of machines in the arcade ?",
