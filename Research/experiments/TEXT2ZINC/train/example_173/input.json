  "description": "This problem is a map coloring problem. Given a number of countries and a matrix representing the connections between these countries, the task is to assign a color to each country such that no two adjacent countries have the same color. The colors are represented as integers from 1 to 4. The connections between countries are represented as a 2D matrix where a 1 indicates a connection and a 0 indicates no connection. The problem is to find a coloring that satisfies these constraints. The solution should be a list of colors assigned to each country in the order [belgium, denmark, france, germany, netherlands, luxembourg].",
