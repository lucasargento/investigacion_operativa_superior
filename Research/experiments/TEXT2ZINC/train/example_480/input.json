  "description": "The problem is about filling a 4x6 table with 18 ticks such that the sum of ticks on each column and row is even and no row or column is empty. The decision variable is a 2D array 'x' of size 4x6 where each element can be either 0 or 1. The objective is to find a configuration of the table that satisfies the constraints. The constraints are: the total number of ticks is 18; the sum of ticks in each row and each column is even; and no row or column is empty. The problem does not have an optimization goal, it is a satisfaction problem. The problem is solved using an integer search strategy that selects the variable with the smallest domain first (first_fail) and assigns it the smallest value in its domain (indomain_min).",
