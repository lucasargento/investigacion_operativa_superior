  "description": "Consider a road illuminated by a number of lamps and divided into a number of segments. Each lamp has a given power. The illumination of the i-th segment is assumed to be \\sum_{j=1}^{M} coeff_{i,j} power_j, where coeff_{i,j} are known coefficients, where M is the number of lamps. We are also given desired illuminations and are interested in choosing the lamp powers so that the illuminations are as close to the desired illuminations as possible. Find the lamp powers that minimize the absolute error between the illuminations which are a result of choosing the lamp powers and the desired illuminations.",
