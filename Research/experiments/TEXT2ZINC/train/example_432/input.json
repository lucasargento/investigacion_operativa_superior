  "description": "The Aircraft Assignment Problem is a mathematical programming model that aims to assign TotalAircraft aircraft to TotalRoutes routes in order to minimize the total cost while satisfying availability and demand constraints. The availability for each aircraft i is Availability_i and it represents the maximum number of routes that the aircraft can be assigned to. The demand for each route j is Demand_j and it denotes the number of aircraft required to fulfill the passenger or cargo needs of the route. The capability of each aircraft i for each route j is given by Capacity_{i,j} and it defines whether the aircraft can service the route, considering factors such as range, size, and suitability. Finally, Cost_{i,j} represents the cost of assigning aircraft i to route j, which includes operational, fuel, and potential opportunity costs.",
