  "description": "The Solitaire Battleships problem involves arranging a fleet of ships on a board according to given rules. The fleet includes ships of varying lengths which are given. The ships cannot be adjacent to each other or diagonally connecting, and the board's row and column sums indicate the number of squares in each row and column that are occupied by ships. Shots have been taken to partially reveal ship locations. The goal is to determine the exact ship placements on the board.",
