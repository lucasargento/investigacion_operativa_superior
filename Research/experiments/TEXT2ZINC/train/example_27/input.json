  "description": "The Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) involves the distribution of goods between depots and customers using a set of vehicles. Each vehicle must serve a subset of customers while respecting its capacity, and each customer has a specific demand that must be met within a predefined time window (given by a lower and upper bound). Additionally, there is a cost associated with traveling between customers (and depots) as well as an expected service time at each customer. The objective is to minimize the total transportation cost while meeting all customer demands within their time windows.",
