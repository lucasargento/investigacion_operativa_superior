  "description": "In the Warehouse Location problem (WLP), a company aims to open warehouses at candidate locations to supply its stores. Each warehouse has a maintenance cost and specific capacity. Each store must be supplied by exactly one warehouse, with supply costs varying per warehouse. The goal is to minimize the sum of maintenance and supply costs by determining which warehouses to open and assigning them to supply stores.",
