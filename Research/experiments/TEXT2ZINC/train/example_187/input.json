  "description": "This problem is a map coloring problem. Given a number of countries and a matrix representing the connections between these countries, the task is to assign a color to each country such that no two adjacent countries have the same color. The colors are represented as integers from 1 to 4. The connections between countries are represented as a 2D matrix where a 1 indicates a connection and a 0 indicates no connection. The problem also includes a symmetry breaking constraint to reduce the number of equivalent solutions. The goal is to find a valid coloring that satisfies all constraints.",
