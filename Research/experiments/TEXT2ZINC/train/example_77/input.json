  "description": "A company produces and sells several different products. The demand for each product is unlimited, but the company is constrained by cash availability and machine capacity. Each unit of each type of product requires a given number of machine hours. There are a certain number of machine hours available in the current production period. Each type of product has a production cost and selling price per unit. There is a fixed amount of cash available. Furthermore, for each type of product, a specific percentage of the sales revenues for each product will be made available to finance operations during the current period. The company could increase its available machines by a certain number of hours by spending a certain number of hours for repairs. The net income from each product is the revenue we get from selling it minus the production cost and the investment cost. We are aiming at maximizing total net income subject to the cash availability and machine capacity limitations.",
