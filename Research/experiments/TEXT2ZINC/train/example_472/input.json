  "description": "The problem is about finding the minimum and maximum values in a set. Given a set S of size 4, with elements ranging from 1 to 10, the task is to find the minimum and maximum values in the set. The minimum value 'mn' is defined as a value that is in the set and for all elements 'e' in the set, 'mn' is less than or equal to 'e'. Similarly, the maximum value 'mx' is defined as a value that is in the set and for all elements 'e' in the set, 'mx' is greater than or equal to 'e'. The goal is to satisfy these conditions.",
