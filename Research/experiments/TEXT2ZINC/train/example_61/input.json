  "description": "The problem involves some departments that need to be located in some cities. Each department has a certain benefit associated with each city, and there are communication costs between each pair of cities. All departments start in a single city, but have the option to relocate to another city. We are given the cost of relocating to the candidate options. The goal is to maximize the total savings, which is the sum of the benefits of each department in each city minus the communication costs between each pair of departments in each pair of cities. The constraints are that each department must be located in one city, and there can be at most 3 departments in each city.",
