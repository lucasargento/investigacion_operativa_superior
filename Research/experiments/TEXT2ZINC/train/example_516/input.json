  "description": "The problem is about finding the smallest number with a persistence of five. A number's persistence is defined as the number of steps required to reduce it to a single digit by multiplying all its digits to obtain a second number, then multiplying all the digits of that number to obtain a third number, and so on until a one-digit number is obtained. For example, the number 77 has a persistence of four because it requires four steps to reduce it to one digit: 77-49-36-18-8. The smallest number of persistence one is 10, of persistence two is 25, of persistence three is 39, and of persistence four is 77. The task is to find the smallest number of persistence five.",
