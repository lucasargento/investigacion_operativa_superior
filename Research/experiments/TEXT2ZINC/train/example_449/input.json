  "description": "Consider a diet problem. Given a set of foods FoodSet and a set of nutrients NutrientSet which is the union of nutrients with minimum requirements MinReqNutrients and nutrients with maximum requirements MaxReqNutrients. Each food j has a cost CostPerFood_j and the amount of each nutrient i it contains is AmountPerNutrient_{i,j}. The problem aims to minimize the total cost of buying foods. It is constrained that the total amount of each nutrient i with minimum requirements in the foods bought is at least MinReqAmount_i and the total amount of each nutrient i with maximum requirements in the foods bought is at most MaxReqAmount_i. How to decide the amount of each food j to buy ?",
