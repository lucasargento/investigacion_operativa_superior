  "description": "The problem is about enforcing two vectors to differ from at least K positions. Given two vectors, VECTOR1 and VECTOR2, and an integer K, the task is to ensure that VECTOR1 and VECTOR2 differ from at least K positions. For example, if K=2, VECTOR1=<2, 5, 2, 0>, and VECTOR2=<3, 6, 2, 1>, the constraint holds since the first and second vectors differ from 3 positions, which is greater than or equal to K=2.",
