  "description": "This problem is taken from the Numerica book, page 21. The problem is to find two real numbers, x[1] and x[2], such that the following two conditions are satisfied: 1) The sum of the squares of x[1] and x[2] is equal to 1. 2) The square of x[1] is equal to x[2]. The search space for the variables x[1] and x[2] is from -10^8 to 10^8. The problem is to find all solutions that satisfy these conditions. The problem also includes an optional additional constraint that x[1] must be greater than or equal to 0.",
