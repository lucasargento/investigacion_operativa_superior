  "description": "The problem is a simple model of kidney exchange, inspired by Pascal Van Hentenryck's introduction of Discrete Optimization. The objective is to maximize the number of exchanges. The problem involves a number of people who are compatible to give or receive a kidney. The compatibility is represented as a directed graph where each person is a node and an edge from node i to node j represents that person i can give a kidney to person j. The decision variables represent who gets whose kidney. The constraints ensure that all the variables are different except for 0 and that anyone who gives a kidney also receives a kidney. The problem is to find an assignment of kidneys such that the number of exchanges is maximized.",
