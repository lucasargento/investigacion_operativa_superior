  "description": "The problem is to color Gardner's graph. The graph is represented by an array of sets, where each set represents the neighbors of a node in the graph. The graph has 110 nodes. The goal is to assign a color to each node, represented by the array x, such that no two adjacent nodes (i.e., nodes that are neighbors) have the same color. There are 4 possible colors, represented by the numbers 1 to 4. The problem is to find a coloring of the graph that satisfies these constraints.",
