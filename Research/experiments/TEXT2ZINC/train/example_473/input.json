  "description": "The problem is about constraining all sequences of a given length (SEQ) from a collection of variables such that the sum of the variables in each sequence falls within a specified interval [LOW, UP]. For example, given a sequence length of 4 and a collection of variables <1, 4, 2, 0, 0, 3, 4>, the problem is to ensure that the sum of every 4 consecutive values in the collection is between 3 and 7. The constraint holds if the sums associated with the subsequences 1 4 2 0, 4 2 0 0, 2 0 0 3, and 0 0 3 4 are respectively 7, 6, 5 and 7, all of which are within the interval [3, 7].",
