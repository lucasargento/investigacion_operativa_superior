  "description": "The goal is to minimize the price of an alloy produced from other alloys available on the market. There are AlloysOnMarket different alloys that can be bought to blend into the final product. The needed composition of the end alloy requires RequiredElements elements. Each alloy on the market has a known composition given by CompositionDataPercentage_{e,a}, which indicates the percentage of element e in alloy a. The desired percentage of each element in the final blend is specified by DesiredBlendPercentage_e. Furthermore, each alloy a on the market comes with a price AlloyPrice_a. The objective of the optimization problem is to determine the quantity of each available alloy that should be used to achieve the desired blend percentages at the minimum total cost, without exceeding the availability of the alloys.",
