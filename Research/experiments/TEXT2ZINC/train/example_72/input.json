  "description": "Custom Tees is planning an online advertising campaign with different ad types across two web companies. The company has set a goal of in the number of clicks from visitors aged 18-25 and another for visitors older than 25. Additionally, there is a unique click goal for visitors from these two age categories as well. For each ad, there is an estimated percentage of clicks from the 18-25 range and an estimated percentage of clicks from the older visitors. Each ad also incurs a cost per 1000 clicks and has a maximum allowable number of clicks. Each ad also has an estimated percentage of unique visitors that is assumed to be the same across all age categories. How many clicks from each ad type should Custom Tees purchase to minimize cost?",
