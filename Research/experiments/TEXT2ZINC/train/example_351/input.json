  "description": "The Fill-a-Pix problem is a Minesweeper-like puzzle based on a grid with a pixilated picture hidden inside. The puzzle consists of a grid containing clues in various places. The objective is to reveal a hidden picture by painting the squares directly around each clue so that the number of painted squares, including the square with the clue, matches the value of the clue. Given a grid with the clues, find which squares should be painted.",
