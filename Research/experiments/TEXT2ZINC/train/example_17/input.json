  "description": "A company produces several kinds of products. Each product of a given type requires a given number of hours of assembly labor, hours of testing, and raw materials (measured in $). Given the current personnel of the company, there is a limit on the number of hours of assembly labor and hours of testing each day. Each type of product has a price. The company also has an upper limit on the number of hours of overtime assembly labor that can be scheduled at an overtime rate in hours. Suppose that a raw material supplier provides a percentage discount if the daily bill is above a given $ threshold. Maximize the daily profit of the company, which is the total revenue minus the total cost.",
