  "description": "A concert is to consist of nine pieces of music of different durations each involving a different combination of the five members of the orchestra. Players can arrive at rehearsals immediately before the first piece in which they are involved and depart immediately after the last piece in which they are involved. The problem is to devise an order in which the pieces can be rehearsed so as to minimize the total time that players are waiting to play, i.e. the total time when players are present but not currently playing. What is this minimum waiting time?",
