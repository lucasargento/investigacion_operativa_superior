  "description": "The problem is known as the 'Twelve draughts puzzle'. It is a puzzle where we have a 4x4 grid and we need to place 12 pieces on it such that there are 5 pieces on each side of the grid and the inner 2x2 squares are unused. The objective is to find a configuration that satisfies these conditions. Each cell in the grid can either be occupied by a piece (represented by 1) or be empty (represented by 0). The problem does not have an objective function, it is a satisfaction problem, meaning that we are only interested in finding a feasible solution that satisfies all the constraints.",
