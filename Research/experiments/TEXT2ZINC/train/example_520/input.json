  "description": "The problem is to construct two cubes which can be used as a calendar, i.e. together can represent the numbers 01..31. One cube has the sides 1,2 and the other 3,4,5. The solution should be such that cube1 = [0,1,2,6,7,8] and cube2 = [0,1,2,3,4,5]. The cubes should be constructed in such a way that they contain all the numbers from 0 to 8 at least once. The numbers on the cubes should be arranged in increasing order and all the numbers on a cube should be different. The numbers on the cubes should be able to represent all the numbers from 1 to 31 in the form of two-digit numbers where the first digit is from one cube and the second digit is from the other cube. The number 9 is represented as 6.",
