  "description": "The problem is a puzzle known as 'The Sixth Trial' from Smullyan, R., (1991), The Lady or The Tiger, Oxford University Press. The puzzle involves two doors and two prizes, a lady and a tiger. Each door hides one prize. The statements on the doors provide clues about what is behind the doors. The statement on door i is true if and only if door i hides prize i. If the statement on door 1 is true (i.e., if the prizes behind doors 1 and 2 are the same), then the variable t[1] is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to 0. Similarly, if the statement on door 2 is true, then the variable t[2] is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to 0. The goal is to find a configuration of prizes behind the doors that satisfies all these conditions.",
