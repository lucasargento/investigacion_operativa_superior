  "description": "The problem is a timetable problem. There are a certain number of courses, each course consists of a certain number of lectures, and there are a certain number of periods. For all courses, all lectures must be assigned to a period in such a way that the following constraints are satisfied: \n\n1. Conflicts: There is a conflict matrix M such that M[i,j] = 1 if courses i and j have common students. Lectures of courses i and j must be all scheduled at different times. \n\n2. Availabilities: There is an availability binary matrix A such that if A[i,j] = 1 then lectures of course i cannot be scheduled at period j. \n\n3. Rooms: There are a certain number of rooms available. At most this number of lectures can be scheduled at each period. \n\nThe goal is to find a timetable that satisfies all these constraints.",
