  "description": "A network faces an intrusion that requires immediate intervention. Interventions include isolating nodes or scanning nodes affected by the intruder which can be done either via central processing or distributed processing. Each cluster of nodes must be treated with one intervention type consistently. The processing times for each type of intervention are different across each cluster and type. There is a specific opportunity cost for processing an intervention via central and via distributed processing. There is a maximum allotment of hours for central processing and for distributed processing. Determine the most cost-effective combination of interventions to halt the intruder's progress within the network.",
