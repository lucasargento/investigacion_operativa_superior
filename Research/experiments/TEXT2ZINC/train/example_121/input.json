  "description": "---\nTitle:    Nonogram\nCategory: Games and puzzles\nProposer: \n    - Gary Duncan\n    - Ian Gent\nCategory: Games and puzzles\n---\n\n\nNonograms are a popular puzzle, which goes by different names in different countries. Solvers have to shade in squares in a grid so that blocks of consecutive shaded squares satisfy constraints given for each row and column. Constraints typically indicate the sequence of shaded blocks (e.g. 3,1,2 means that there is a block of 3, then a gap of unspecified size, a block of length 1, another gap, and then a block of length 2).",
