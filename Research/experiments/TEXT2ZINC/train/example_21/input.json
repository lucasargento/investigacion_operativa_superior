  "description": "A Golomb ruler is a set of $m$ integers $0 = a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_m$ such that the $m(m-1)/2$ differences $a_j - a_i, 1 <= i < j <= m$ are distinct. The objective is to find the optimal or near optimal Golomb ruler of minimum length. Symmetry can be removed by adding the constraint that $a_2 - a_1 < a_m - a_{m-1}$ where the first difference is less than the last. The ruler is not required to measure all distances up to its length, but each distance must be measured in only one way. Given the number of marks on a Golomb ruler, find the length of the smallest Golomb ruler with those many marks.",
