%  *  This origin of this problem is from 
%     S. French: "Sequencing and Scheduling : 
%              an introduction to the mathematics of the
%              job-shop", Ellis Horwood Limited, 1982.

%  * Tim Duncan wrote about it in his paper
%    "Scheduling Problems and Constraint Logic Programming:
%     A Simple Example and its Solution", AIAI-TR-120, 1990,
%     page 5. 
%     (The paper also includes a program in CHIP 
%     solving the problem.)
