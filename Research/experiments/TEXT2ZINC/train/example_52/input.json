  "description": "The Job-shop problem involves scheduling a set of jobs on a set of machines where each job has a defined duration on each machine and a specified order of processing across machines. The objective is to minimize the earliest end time while ensuring that jobs do not overlap on a machine and are processed in the correct order across machines.",
