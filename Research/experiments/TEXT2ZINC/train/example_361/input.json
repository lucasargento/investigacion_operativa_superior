  "description": "Given a string with numbers from 1 to n concatenated in random order, but missing one number, the task is to find the missing number. The numbers are represented as an array of digits. The problem is inspired by a question on StackOverflow and Quora. The model sometimes finds spurious solutions, especially if it's an ordered list. For ordered sequences there are many solutions. However, for randomly ordered problems, it seems to be just a few solutions and all with the correct missing number. In this model, it is assumed that the range of the numbers is known, i.e., the maximum number of the original sequence is known.",
