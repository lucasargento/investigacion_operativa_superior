  "description": "The Timetable problem involves scheduling lectures for a given number of courses, each comprising a given number of lectures, across a given number of periods. Some courses have conflicts between them and can't be scheduled at the same time. Courses are only available to be scheduled for certain times, and there's a limit on the number of lectures that can be scheduled per period. Each course has a required number of lectures. The objective is to allocate lectures to periods satisfying all constraints.",
