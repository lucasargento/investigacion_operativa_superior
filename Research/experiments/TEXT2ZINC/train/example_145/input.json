As well as finding magic squares, we are interested in the number\nof a given size that exist.  There are several interesting\nvariations. For example, we may insist on certain values in certain\nsquares (like in quasigroup completion) and ask if the magic square\ncan be completed. In a heterosquare, each row, column and diagonal\nsums to a different value. In an anti-magic square, the row, column\nand diagonal sums form a sequence of consecutive integers.\n\nA magic sequence of length $n$ is a sequence of integers $x_0 \\ldots\nx_{n-1}$ between $0$ and $n-1$, such that for all $i$ in $0$ to $n-1$,\nthe number $i$ occurs exactly $x_i$ times in the sequence. For instance,\n$6,2,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0$ is a magic sequence since $0$ occurs $6$ times\nin it, $1$ occurs twice, etc.",
