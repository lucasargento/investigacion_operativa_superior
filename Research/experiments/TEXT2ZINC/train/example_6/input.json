  "description": "We are trying to determine the optimal selling, storing, and manufacturing policy for a company to maximize its profit. We are given the number of machines the company has and the number of different products it produces. Each product has a known profit. For each product, we are also given the time required on each machine. For each month, we know the a of machines of each type that will be down for maintenance. Additionally, there is a limitation of how much of each product may be produced in each month. Further, to store products, there is a limit of 100 of each type at a cost per unit per month. The company originally starts with no stock of any type of product, but there is a minimum stock that should be stored of each type of product at the end of subsequent months. Assuming that the factory works six days a week for a fixed number of hours a day and that a month has exactly 24 days for convenience if no sequencing problems need to be considered, what selling, storing, and manufacturing policy should the company pursue to maximize profit?",
