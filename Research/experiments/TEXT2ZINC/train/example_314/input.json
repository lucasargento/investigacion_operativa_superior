  "description": "This problem is known as 'The Second Trial' puzzle, originally from Smullyan, R., (1991), The Lady or The Tiger, Oxford University Press. The puzzle involves two doors and two prizes (1 = Lady, 2 = Tiger). Each door hides one prize. The puzzle is represented by two arrays: x[i,j] = 1 if door i hides prize j, else 0 and t[i] = 1 if the statement on door i is true, else 0. The constraints of the problem are as follows: each door hides 1 prize; if the statement on door 1 is true then t[1] = 1, else t[1] = 0; if the statement on door 2 is true then t[2] = 1, else t[2] = 0; and the statements on both doors are either both true or both false. The goal is to find a satisfying assignment for the arrays x and t that meets all these constraints.",
