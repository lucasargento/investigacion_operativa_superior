  "description": "The capacitated warehouse location problem involves locating warehouses which are to service customers, at minimum cost. Each customer has an associated demand. There are constraints on the total demand that can be met from each warehouse. Costs are incurred when allocating service to customers from warehouses, and warehouses have a fixed operating cost. Additionally, there is a lower limit on the amount of demand that a warehouse must meet if it is opened, as well as constraints on the minimum and maximum number of warehouses that can be operational. The objective is to allocate customers to warehouses and which warehouses to open in order to minimize the total cost.",
