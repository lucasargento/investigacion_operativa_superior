  "description": "The problem is a mathematical puzzle from the Norwegian Math Olympiad. The numbers a, b, and c are positive integers. An apple cost $a, a banana costs $b, and a cherry costs $c. The cost of b apples, b bananas, and a + b cherries is $77. The task is to find the cost for one apple, two bananas, and one cherry. The solution should satisfy the following constraints: b*a + b*b + (a+b)*c = 77, y = a + 2*b + c, y > 0, a > 0, b > 0, c > 0. The solution is y=18, which represents the total cost for one apple, two bananas, and one cherry.",
