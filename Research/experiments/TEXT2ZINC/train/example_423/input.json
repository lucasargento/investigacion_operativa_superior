  "description": "An engineering company has new grad engineers earning $ 1000 a week and senior engineers earning $ 3000 a week . The weekly wage bill must be kept below $ 100000 . The projects require a minimum of 50 engineers of whom at least 10 must be senior engineers . In addition , the number of senior engineers should be at least a third the number of new grad engineers . Formulate a LP to minimize the wage bill .",
