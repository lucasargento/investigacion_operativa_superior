  "description": "A TCM company makes powdered medicine in two different packages , a regular package and premium package , to sell to TCM doctors . The regular package requires 100 g of medicinal herbs and 30 seconds of drying . A premium package requires 130 units of medicinal herbs and 60 seconds of drying . The company has available 9000 units of medicinal herbs and has available 3500 seconds in the drying machine . Since the premium package sells better , the number of regular packages must be less than the number of premium packages . In addition , the company must make at least 15 regular packages . If a regular package can treat 2 people and a premium batch can treat 3 people , how many of each type of package should be made to maximize the number of people that can be treated ?",
