  "description": "The Knapsack Problem is a classic optimization problem in operations research and computer science. The problem is to determine the most valuable combination of items to include in a knapsack, given a set of TotalItems with different values and weights represented by ItemValues and ItemWeights respectively, and a maximum weight capacity of the knapsack MaxKnapsackWeight. The goal is to maximize the total value of the items in the knapsack, represented by ItemValues, without exceeding its weight capacity MaxKnapsackWeight.",
