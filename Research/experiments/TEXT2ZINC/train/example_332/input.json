  "description": "The problem is to create a matrix where all values on each row/column are different (except for the blanks). A set of hints is given: The (or some) first seen non blank of each upper row, lower row, left column, and right column seen from that view. The hints are coded as follows: blank -> 0, A -> 1, B -> 2, etc. The objective is to satisfy these conditions and fill the matrix accordingly. The size of the square matrix is 'n' and the numbers to place in each row/column is 'm'. The number of zeros is 'n-m'. The first 'visible' number except empty square for each row and column are given as hints. The problem is to find a solution that satisfies all these conditions.",
