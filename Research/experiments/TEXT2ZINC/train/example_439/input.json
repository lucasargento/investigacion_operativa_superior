  "description": "Capacitated facility location problems deal with locating NumberOfFacilities facilities to serve NumberOfCustomers customers, at minimum total cost. Considering potential facility locations and customer zones as fixed points in a network, each facility has a fixed FacilityFixedCost and a FacilityCapacity. Furthermore, there exists a CustomerDemand for each customer zone, and a FacilityToCustomerTransportCost representing the cost of transport between facilities and customer zones.",
